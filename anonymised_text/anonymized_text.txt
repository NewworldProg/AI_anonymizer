HEADLINE: Membership gives the[ORG_2] jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed in[MISC_1] territories since last June .
[LOC_1] and the[LOC_2] opposed the move, which could open the door to war crimes investigations against [LOC_1]is .
========================================
([ORG_3])The[MISC_1] Authority officially became the 123rd member of the[ORG_5] on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in[MISC_1] territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at[LOC_3], in the[LOC_4], where the court is based. The[MISC_1]s signed the[ORG_2]'s founding[MISC_4] in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed "in the occupied[MISC_1] territory, including[LOC_5], since June 13, 2014." Later that [LOC_5], since June 13, 2014." Later that month, the[ORG_2] opened a preliminary examination into the situation in[MISC_1] territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against[MISC_2]. As members of the court,[MISC_1]s may be subject to counter-charges as well.[LOC_6] and the[LOC_2], neither of which is an[ORG_2] member, opposed the[MISC_1]s' efforts to join the body. But[MISC_1] Foreign Minister[PER_1], speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. "As[LOC_7] formally becomes a State Party to the[MISC_4] today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice," he said, according to an[ORG_2] news release. "Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace." Judge[PER_2], a vice president of the[ORG_2], said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the[MISC_1]s. "As the[MISC_4] today enters into force for the State of[LOC_7],[LOC_7] acquireorce for the State of[LOC_7],[LOC_7] acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly," she said. Rights group[ORG_6] welcomed the development. "Governments seeking to penalize[LOC_7] for joining the[ORG_2] should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership," said[PER_3], international justice counsel for the group. "What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not[LOC_7]'s decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members." In January, when the preliminary[ORG_2] examination was opened,[MISC_5] Prime Minister[PER_4] described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The[LOC_2] also said it "strongly" disagreed with the court's decision. "As we have said repeatedth the court's decision. "As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that[LOC_7] is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the[ORG_2]," the[ORG_7] said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. "We will continue to oppose actions against[LOC_6] at the[ORG_2] as counterproductive to the cause of peace," it said. But the[ORG_2] begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as "[LOC_8]." While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor[PER_5] said her office would "conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality." The war between[LOC_6] and[ORG_8] militants in[LOC_9] last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The[ORG_5] was set up in 2002 to pternational Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.[ORG_10]'s[PER_6],[PER_7] and[PER_8] contributed to this report.

========================================
([ORG_3])Never mind cats having nine lives. A stray pooch in[LOC_10] has used up at least three of her own after being hit by a car, apparently whacked on the head with a hammer in a misguided mercy killing and then buried in a field -- only to survive. That's according to[LOC_10] Uni survive. That's according to[ORG_12], where the dog -- a friendly white-and-black bully breed mix now named[PER_9] -- has been receiving care at the[LOC_11]. Four days after her apparent death, the dog managed to stagger to a nearby farm, dirt-covered and emaciated, where she was found by a worker who took her to a vet for help. She was taken in by[LOC_12],[LOC_13], resident[PER_10]. "Considering everything that she's been through, she's incredibly gentle and loving,"[PER_11] said, according to[ORG_13]. "She's a true miracle dog and she deserves a good life."[PER_9] is only one year old but the dog's brush with death did not leave her unscathed. She suffered a dislocated jaw, leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe. The veterinary hospital's[ORG_14] committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog's treatment, but[PER_11] has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the doing page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog's care. She's also created a Facebook page to keep supporters updated. Donors have already surpassed the $10,000 target, inspired by[PER_9]'s tale of survival against the odds. On the fundraising page,[PER_11] writes, "She is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw. I agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home." She is dedicated to making sure[PER_9] gets the medical attention she needs,[PER_11] adds, and wants to "make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again!" Any additional funds raised will be "paid forward" to help other animals.[PER_9] is not the only animal to apparently rise from the grave in recent weeks. A cat in[LOC_14],[LOC_15], found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car in January, showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried by his owner. The cat was in bad shape, with maggots covering open wounds on his body and a ruined lts covering open wounds on his body and a ruined left eye, but remarkably survived with the help of treatment from the[ORG_15][LOC_16]

The[MISC_6] foreign minister tweets in[MISC_7] [LOC_16]
========================================
([ORG_3])If you've been following the news lately, there are certain things you doubtless know about[PER_12][LOC_16] He is, of course, the[MISC_6] foreign minister[LOC_16] He has been[LOC_18][LOC_16]S[LOC_16] Secretary of State[PER_13]'s opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against[LOC_20] -- if the detail an end to sanctions against[LOC_20] -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks. And he received a hero's welcome as he arrived in[LOC_20] on a sunny Friday morning. "Long live[PER_14]," crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street. You may well have read that he is "polished" and, unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues, "jovial." An Internet search for "Mohammad Javad[PER_14]" and "jovial" yields thousands of results. He certainly has gone a long way to bring[LOC_20] in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community. But there are some facts about[PER_14] that are less well-known. Here are six: . In September 2013,[PER_14] tweeted "Happy[MISC_8]," referring to the[MISC_9]. That prompted[PER_16], the daughter of[ORG_16] Leader[PER_17], to respond with a tweet of her own: "Thanks. The[MISC_10] would be even sweeter if you would end[LOC_20]'s[MISC_11] denial, sir." And, perhaps to her surprise,[PER_18] got a response. "[LOC_21] never deniesurprise,[PER_18] got a response. "[LOC_21] never denied it,"[PER_14] tweeted back. "The man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone. Happy[MISC_10]." The reference was likely to former [LOC_21]ian President[PER_19], who had left office the previous month.[PER_14] was nominated to be foreign minister by[PER_20]'s successor,[PER_21]. His foreign ministry notes, perhaps defensively, that "due to the political and security conditions of the time, he decided to continue his education in the[LOC_2]." That is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the Shah of [LOC_21], which began in 1977, and during the [LOC_21]ian Revolution, which drove the shah from power in 1979.[PER_14] left the country in 1977, received his undergraduate degree from[ORG_17] in 1981, his master's in international relations from the[ORG_18] in 1984 and his doctorate from the[ORG_18] in 1988. Both of his children were born in the Unitn 1988. Both of his children were born in the[LOC_22] The website of the[MISC_6][ORG_19], which[PER_14] runs, cannot even agree with itself on when he was born. The first sentence of his official biography, perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in[LOC_23], says[PER_14] was "born to a religious traditional family in[LOC_23] in 1959." Later on the same page, however, his date of birth is listed as January 8, 1960. And the[MISC_6] Diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . So he is 54, 55 or maybe even 56. Whichever, he is still considerably younger than his opposite number,[PER_22], who is 71. The feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the[ORG_21], a charitable organization. The[ORG_22].[ORG_23] said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the[MISC_6] government to launder money and get around[ORG_22]. sanctions. But last year, a settlement in the case, under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in[LOC_25] along with other properties to tding in[LOC_25] along with other properties to the[LOC_18][LOC_16][LOC_19] government, did not mention[PER_14]'s name[LOC_16] Early in the[MISC_12],[PER_14] was among the students who took over the[MISC_6] Consulate in San Francisco[LOC_16] The aim, says the website[MISC_6][LOC_16]com -- which cites[PER_14]'s memoirs, titled "Mr[LOC_16] Ambassador" -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently[MISC_13][LOC_16] Later, the website says,[PER_14] went to make a similar protest at the[MISC_6] mission to the[LOC_18]nited Nations[LOC_16] In response, the[MISC_6] ambassador to the[LOC_18]nited Nations offered him a job[LOC_16] In fact, he has now spent more time with[PER_22] than any other foreign minister in the world[LOC_16] And that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men, with help from other foreign ministers as well, try to meet a June 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in[LOC_27][LOC_16]

========================================
(CNN)A[ORG_31] student has admitted to hanging a noose made of rope from a tree near a student union, university officials said Thursday. The prestigious private school didn't identify the student, citing federal privacy laws. In a news release, it said the student was no longer on campus and will face student conduct review. The student was identified during an investigation by campus police and the office of student affairs and admitted to placing the noose on the tree early Wednesday, the university said. Officials are still trying to determine if other people were involved. Criminal investigations into the incident are ongoing as well. Students and faculty members marched Wednesdayll. Students and faculty members marched Wednesday afternoon chanting "We are not afraid. We stand together,"  after pictures of the noose were passed around on social media. At a forum held on the steps of[LOC_37], close to where the noose was discovered at 2 a.m., hundreds of people gathered. "You came here for the reason that you want to say with me, 'This is no[ORG_31] we will accept. This is no[ORG_31] we want. This is not the[ORG_31] we're here to experience. And this is not the[ORG_31] we're here to create,' "[ORG_31] President[PER_24] told the crowd. The incident is one of several recent racist events to affect college students.

In February, a noose was hung around the neck of a statue of a famous civil rights figure at the[ORG_33]. A statement issued by[ORG_31] said there was a previous repoment issued by[ORG_31] said there was a previous report of hate speech directed at students on campus. In the news release, the vice president for student affairs called the noose incident a "cowardly act."

Organization claims that governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism to advance executions .
The number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% compared with 2013, but death sentences up by 28% .
========================================
([ORG_3])Governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions,[ORG_40] alleges in its annual report on the death penalty. "The dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year," said[PER_39],[ORG_38]'s Secretary General in a release. "It is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people's lives -- putting people to death for 'terrorism' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence." The report, "Death Sentences and Executions 2014," cites the example of[LOC_42]nces and Executions 2014," cites the example of[LOC_43] lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in[LOC_44] in December.[LOC_45] is also mentioned, as having used the death penalty as a tool in its "[MISC_19]" campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of[LOC_46]. The annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe, and this year's edition contains some mixed findings. On one hand, the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22% on the previous year. At least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014, compared to 778 in 2013.[ORG_38]'s figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in[LOC_45], where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret.[LOC_47] and[LOC_48], too, do not release data on death penalty cases. "The long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions (worldwide),"[PER_40]e in the number of executions (worldwide),"[PER_41],[ORG_38]'s Director of Global Issues, told[ORG_10]. "A number of countries are closer to abolition, and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015. (There are) signals of a world that is nearing abolition." While the report notes some encouraging signs, it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014. At least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year, an increase of 28% compared with 2013. The report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including[LOC_49] and[LOC_50], "against scores of people in some cases." The organization found "positive developments" worldwide, with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions. Opinion: Sharp spike in death sentences . Sub-Saharan[LOC_51], for example, saw a 28% fall in reported cases, and executions recorded in the[LOC_52] and North[LOC_51] were recorded in the[LOC_52] and[LOC_53] were down 23% compared to 2013[LOC_16] "Even though we've highlighted some of the negative developments[LOC_16][LOC_16][LOC_16] I think we would always highlight that there are positive developments,"[PER_42] said[LOC_16] "Across the board, with the exception of[LOC_54] and[LOC_55] there were fewer reports of executions in every region[LOC_16]" The resumption of the use of capital punishment in[LOC_47] -- the only country in[LOC_54] and[LOC_55] to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region[LOC_16] The[LOC_2] has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the[LOC_56] to conduct executions, but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly, from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014[LOC_16] The state of[LOC_13] also imposed a moratorium on executions last year[LOC_16] The[LOC_18][LOC_16]S[LOC_16] remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment, with only[LOC_20] (289+),[LOC_57] (61+), and[LOC_58] (90+) executing more people 1+), and[LOC_58] (90+) executing more people in 2014. While figures are not available,[ORG_38] estimates that[LOC_45] also executes "thousands" of prisoners each year, "more than the rest of the world put together." The report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death. "In the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed, the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards," the report stated. "In 2014[ORG_38] International raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in[LOC_59],[LOC_60],[LOC_45],[LOC_49],[LOC_20],[LOC_57],[LOC_61],[LOC_43],[LOC_58] and[LOC_62]." The[ORG_24] Secretary-General,[PER_43], last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment. "The taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another," he said, in marking[MISC_20] in October. "We must continue ainst Death Penalty in October. "We must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights."[ORG_38] estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014.

========================================
([ORG_3])[PER_77] is hardly the first actor to die during a production. But[PER_78]'s death in November 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the[MISC_30]" film franchise. The release of "[MISC_29]" on Friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in[LOC_75]. "He was a person of humility, integrity, and compassion," military veteran[PER_79] said in an email to [ORG_3].[PER_78] secretly paid for the engagement ring[PER_80] shopped for with his bride. "We didn't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him. I know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us," said[PER_80]. The actor was on break from filming "[MISC_29]" at the time of the fiery accident, which also claimed the life of the car's driver,[PER_81]. Producers said early on that theyer,[PER_81]. Producers said early on that they would not kill off[PER_78]'s character,[PER_82], a former cop turned road racer. Instead, the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes, with[PER_78]'s brothers,[PER_83] and[PER_84], serving as body doubles. There are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending, in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to[PER_78] while "retiring" his character. At the premiere Wednesday night in[LOC_75],[PER_78]'s co-star and close friend[PER_85] gave a tearful speech before the screening, saying "This movie is more than a movie." "You'll feel it when you see it,"[PER_86] said. "There's something emotional that happens to you, where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you're gonna see them." There have been multiple tributes to[PER_78] leading up to the release.[PER_86] revealed in an interview with the "[ORG_50]" show that he had in an interview with the "[ORG_50]" show that he had named his newborn[PER_87]aughter after[PER_78].

Most had never met him.[PER_88] told[ORG_10] he spent almost $1,000 to truck in a banner from[LOC_77] for people to sign at the memorial. "It's like losing a friend or a really close family member ... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face,"[PER_89] said. "Sitting there, bringing his movies into your house or watching on TV, it's like getting to know somebody. It really, really hurts."[PER_78]'s younger brother[PER_83] told[ORG_51] magazine that he was initially nervous about how "[MISC_29]" would turn out, but he is happy with the film.

Researchers re-examined archives and testimonies of survivors .
[PER_93] and older sister[PER_94] are believed to have died in February 1945 .
========================================
([ORG_3])Seventy years ago,[PER_92] died of typhus in a[MISC_31] concentration camp at the age of 15. Just two weeks after her supposed death on March 31, 1945, the[LOC_78] concentration camp where she had been imprisoned was liberated -- timing that showed how close the[MISC_32] diarist had been to surviving the[MISC_11]. But new research released by the[PER_92] House shows that [PER_93] and her older sister,[PER_94], died at least a month earlier than previously thought. Researchers re-examined archives of the[ORG_52], the[ORG_53]hers re-examined archives of the[ORG_52], the[ORG_54] and the[LOC_79], along with testimonies of survivors. They concluded that[PER_95] and[PER_96] probably did not survive to March 1945 -- contradicting the date of death which had previously been determined by[MISC_33] authorities. In 1944,[PER_95] and seven others hiding in the[LOC_80] secret annex were arrested and sent to the [LOC_81] concentration camp.[PER_95] Frank's final entry . That same year,[PER_95] and[PER_96] were separated from their mother and sent away to work as slave labor at the[LOC_78] camp in[LOC_82]. Days at the camp were filled with terror and dread, witnesses said. The sisters stayed in a section of the overcrowded camp with no lighting, little water and no latrine. They slept on lice-ridden straw and violent storms shredded the tents, according to the researchers. Like the other prisoners, the sisters endured long hours at roll call. Her classmate,[PER_97], recalled seeing[PER_95] there imate,[PER_97], recalled seeing[PER_95] there in December 1944: "She was no more than a skeleton by then. She was wrapped in a blanket; she couldn't bear to wear her clothes anymore because they were crawling with lice." Listen to[PER_95] Frank's friends describe her concentration camp experience . As the[MISC_34] advanced further, the[LOC_78] concentration camp became even more crowded, bringing more disease. A deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day. Typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene. The disease causes high fever, chills and skin eruptions. "Because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes,[PER_95] was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period," museum researchers wrote. They concluded that it's unlikely the sisters survived until March, because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before February 7. "Most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first sympphus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear," wrote  authors[PER_98] and[PER_99]. The exact dates of death for[PER_95] and[PER_96] remain unclear.[PER_96] died before[PER_95]. "[PER_93] never gave up hope," said[PER_100], her friend. "She was absolutely convinced she would survive." Her diary endures as one of the world's most popular books. Read more about[PER_95] Frank's cousin, a keeper of her legacy .

([ORG_3])A year ago[PER_105]=========================
([ORG_3])A year ago[ORG_55] published a story with the following headline:[PER_106], a[PER_107] Favorite, Mulls 2016 Run for President. The story ticked off items on[PER_108]'s conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed[PER_107] brothers, as well as other right-wing lobbying groups. Last August the[LOC_83] governor was in[LOC_85] for an[ORG_56] event; the group is backed by the conservative[PER_107] brothers, and supported Gov.[PER_108]'s tax-slashing budget. Now,[PER_108] is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians.  Why would[PER_108] ignore the pleas of[LOC_83]'s[ORG_57] as well as the[MISC_38] mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill? Because there's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was[PER_108]'s way of shoring up his street cred. It is also the reason whoring up his street cred. It is also the reason why[MISC_38][PER_109],[PER_108]'s fellow[LOC_86] hopeful, who is viewed as a little light in that category, was first to rush in to defend[PER_108] and the law. One lesson here: Just because more than 70% of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70% of the country is happy about it. Backlash aside, the fact is[PER_108] has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives. And while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump, the very public debate that now embroils him — and[LOC_87] Gov. [PER_110], and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire[MISC_38] field farther to the right than the party had hoped.[PER_108]: 'Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no.' For there is no way a[MISC_38] can get through the pending primary without denouncing[MISC_35] rights, which unfortunately will turn numerous[MISC_14] into single-issue ly will turn numerous[MISC_14] into single-issue voters[PER_31] I foolishly hoped the issue of[MISC_35] rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election, overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy[PER_31] Instead it looks like it's going to be dragged down to a replay of[PER_111]'s "cultural war" speech, during which he told the 1992[MISC_39]: "We stand with (George H[PER_31]W[PER_31][PER_114]) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women" and later followed with "There is a religious war going on in this country[PER_31] It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the[MISC_40] itself[PER_31] For this war is for the soul of[LOC_84][PER_31]" Progressives may enjoy watching[PER_108]'s temporary fall from grace, but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful Sen[PER_31][PER_113] of[LOC_88], who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the[MISC_37] table[PER_31] And even if you think neither[PER_108] nor[PER_114] nor[PER_115] will win the nomk neither[PER_108] nor[PER_114] nor[PER_115] will win the nomination, someone has to. In light of that, listen to conservative former[LOC_87] Gov.[PER_116], a potential 2016 candidate describing  conservatives' discomfort with same-sex marriage: "It's like asking someone who's[MISC_32] to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli." Or[LOC_89] Gov.[PER_117]: "I certainly will support Ted[PER_115] and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage." Or[LOC_90] Gov.[PER_118], who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions. And[PER_119] said jail turns people gay, so there's that. Remember:[PER_108] didn't act alone. He only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials. In fact, according to the[ORG_58], "the[MISC_41] [[MISC_42]] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to diallow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate. Numerous other bills specifically single out the[MISC_35] community for unequal treatment." Who supports, denounces[LOC_83] law?[ORG_59] Polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly, but the trend on the state level tells a different story. Perhaps we're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases. Or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated. Former Rep.[PER_120] of[LOC_91], the first member of[ORG_60] to marry someone of the same sex while in office, said he believes[MISC_43] want the[ORG_61] to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the[MISC_37] primary. "We're winning," he told a crowd in[LOC_92] recently while promoting his latest book. I guess if you look at where the country was on[MISC_35] issues 10 years ago, we definitely are. That's assuming you are part of the "we" who believe[MISC_35] people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. But as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts. But as the situation in[LOC_83] has shown, "winning" should not be mistaken for having "won." For it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called "religious freedom" bills snaking through red-state legislatures. Or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop, especially with[MISC_43] controlling both the[ORG_62] and the[ORG_63].[PER_108], and to a lesser extent,[PER_109], may be toxic now but[LOC_84] has a short attention span. More importantly, they are not alone.[PER_121] said when progressives get angry they march in the streets, and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls. If that holds true in 2016, "winning" is going to feel very strange.

[ORG_69] and other high-profile businesses are showing their support for gay and lesbian rights .
Their stance puts them in conflict with socially conservative[MISC_38]s, traditionally seen as allies .
========================================
([ORG_3])As goes[ORG_68], so goes the nation? Everyone from[ORG_70] CEO[PER_137] to the head of the[ORG_71] slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week, warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers. But it was the opposition from[ORG_68], the ubiquitous retailer that dots the[MISC_21] landscape, that perhaps resonated most deeply, providing the latest evidence of growing suppory, providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland.[ORG_68]'s staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of[LOC_87] came after the company said in February it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage. Taken together, the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals. And some prominent[MISC_43] are urging the party to take notice. Former[LOC_93] Gov.[PER_138], who famously called on the GOP to "be the party of[ORG_72], not just the country club," told[ORG_10] that[ORG_68]'s actions "foreshadow where the Republican[ORG_73] will need to move." "The Republican[ORG_73] will have to better stand for" ideas on helping the middle class, said[PER_139], the head of the[ORG_74], a[LOC_13] lobbying group for the finance industry. The party's leaders must be "willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers, such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage, and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs, housing, public accommodation against gays and lesbians."[ORG_68], which employs more than 50,000 people in[LOC_87], emerged victorious on Wednesday. Hours after the company's CEO,[PER_140], called on[MISC_38] Gov.[PER_110] to veto the bill, the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed.[ORG_68]'s opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the[MISC_38] Party, which the company's political action committee has tended to support. In 2004, the[ORG_68] PAC gave around $2 million to[MISC_38]s versus less than $500,000 to[MISC_50], according to data from the[ORG_77]. That gap has grown less pronounced in recent years. In 2014, the PAC spent about $1.3 million to support[MISC_38]s and around $970,000 fllion to support[MISC_43] and around $970,000 for[MISC_50]. It has been a gradual transformation for[ORG_68]. In 2011, the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity. Two years later, the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014. Retail experts say[ORG_68]'s evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base, as well as a recognition of the country's increasingly progressive views of gay equality (support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59%, according to a recent[ORG_78] poll). "It's easy for someone like a[ORG_79] to take a really polarizing position," said[PER_141], a partner at the retail consulting firm[ORG_80]. "But in the world of the largest retailer in the world, that's very different."[PER_142] added: Same-sex marriage, "while divisive, it's becoming more common place here within thee, it's becoming more common place here within the[LOC_94][LOC_16], and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer[LOC_16]" The backlash over the religious freedom measures in[LOC_83] and[LOC_87] this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality[LOC_16] After[LOC_83] Gov[LOC_16][PER_106], a[MISC_38], signed his state's religious freedom bill into law, CEOs of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the Hoosier state[LOC_16] The resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions, including[PER_143], CEO of the business-rating website[ORG_81] and a one-time campaign manager for former[LOC_83] Gov[LOC_16][PER_144][LOC_16][PER_145] announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in[LOC_83]polis in light of the state's passage of the religious freedom act[LOC_16][ORG_82], scheduled to hold a race in[LOC_83]polis this summer, also spoke out against the[LOC_83] law[LOC_16] s summer, also spoke out against the[LOC_83] law. "What we're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business," said[PER_146], spokesman for the[ORG_83]. The debate has reached presidential politics. National[MISC_43] are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination. Likely[MISC_37] presidential candidate[PER_109] initially backed[LOC_83]'s religious freedom law and[PER_108], but moderated his tone a few days later. The former[LOC_15] governor said Wednesday that[LOC_83] could have taken a "better" and "more consensus-oriented approach." "By the end of the week,[LOC_83] will be in the right place,"[PER_114] said, a reference to[PER_108]'s promise this week to fix his state's law in light of the widespread backlash. Others in the[MISC_37] field are digging in. Sen.[PER_113] of[LOC_88], the only officially dein. Sen.[PER_113] of[LOC_88], the only officially declared[MISC_38] presidential candidate, said Wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing[PER_108] and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law. "I think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda,"[PER_115] said. Meanwhile, former Secretary of State[PER_147], who previously served on[ORG_68]'s board of directors, called on[PER_148] to veto the[LOC_87] bill, saying it would "permit unfair discrimination" against the[MISC_35] community.[PER_149], CEO of the[ORG_84] in[LOC_87], welcomed[PER_148]'s pledge on Wednesday to seek changes to his state's bill. He said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies. "When it comes to culture and quality of life, businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacsted in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that's its people,"[PER_150] said. "Therefore, when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things, then the business community will again speak and speak loudly."

[PER_151]: Countries that use executions to deal with problems are on the wrong side of history .
========================================
(CNN)On May 28, 2014, some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in[LOC_45]'s northwestern[LOC_46] region. But they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorit other grand sporting event. Instead, the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits. Armed soldiers guarded the exits. In the patently unfair, open air trial that followed, 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed. Three were sentenced to death. The public mass sentencing was part a[LOC_45]'s "[MISC_19]" campaign against unrest in[LOC_46], a campaign the government claims was launched to combat "terrorism" and "separatism." But it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided, and often cynical, attempt to tackle crime and terrorism. Today,[ORG_40] releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide.  Much of it makes for grim reading. In[LOC_43], the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific Taliban attack on a school in[LOC_44] in December. More than 60 pn a school in[LOC_44] in December. More than 60 people have been put to death since, and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows. [LOC_20] and[LOC_57] executed people for "terrorism," and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes. In a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before, governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism. Other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates.[LOC_96] ended an eight-year moratorium in December, putting 11 murder convicts to death, with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime.  In[LOC_97], authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety "national emergency." Six people have already been executed this year. A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 A sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool.  The rise was largely because of developments in[LOC_49] and[LOC_50], where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict. The simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both. There is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence, as[ORG_24] and other studies have repeatedly confirmed. It is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough. At[ORG_40], we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades. Thankfully, most of the world now appears to agree with us. The numbers speak for themselves. In 1945 when the[ORG_24] was founded, only In 1945 when the[ORG_24] was founded, only eight countries had abolished the death penalty. Today, 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice. Last year, we recorded executions in 22 countries, down by almost a half from 20 years ago. Despite the troubling developments we recorded last year, there was still much good news to be found. The number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year, from 778 to 607. This number does not include[LOC_45], where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together, but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret, the true figure is impossible to determine. Executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-Saharan[LOC_51] --[LOC_98],[LOC_99] and[LOC_100] -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter. The[LOC_56] continued to be execution-free, apart from the[LOC_2]. Those governments that still execute need to realize that they ares that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history. They must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment. Fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task, but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment. With determination, I know that we can achieve this goal.

[LOC_102],[LOC_103] ([ORG_3])The[MISC_51] prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of[MISC_52] insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane. [LOC_102] prosecutor[PER_153] told [ORG_3] that "so far no videos were used in the crash investigation." He added, "A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators."[PER_154]'s comments follow claims by two magazines,[MISC_53] daily[ORG_85] and[MISC_51][ORG_86], of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board[MISC_52] as it crashed into the[MISC_51][LOC_104]. All 150 on board were killed.[ORG_86] and[ORG_85] reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site. The two publications described the supposed video, but did not post it on their websites. The publications said that they watched the video, which was found by a source close to the investigation. "One can hear cries of 'My God' in several languages,"[ORG_88] hear cries of 'My God' in several languages,"[ORG_86] reported. "Metallic banging can also be heard more than three times, perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object.  Towards the end, after a heavy shake, stronger than the others, the screaming intensifies. Then nothing." "It is a very disturbing scene," said[PER_155], editor-in-chief of[ORG_85] online. An official with[LOC_103]'s accident investigation agency, the[ORG_89], said the agency is not aware of any such video. Lt. Col.[PER_156], a[MISC_51] Gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the[ORG_90] crash site, told[ORG_10] that the reports were "completely wrong" and "unwarranted." Cell phones have been collected at the site, he said, but that they "hadn't been exploited yet."[PER_157] said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the[ORG_91] in[LOC_105], near[LOC_106], in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand wiby specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators. But none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute,[PER_157] said. Asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media,[PER_157] answered with a categorical "no."[PER_158] told "Erin Burnett: Outfront" that he had watched the video and stood by the report, saying[ORG_85] and[ORG_86] are "very confident" that the clip is real. He noted that investigators only revealed they'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after[ORG_85] and[ORG_86] published their reports. "That is something we did not know before. ... Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning," he said.

Email correspondence between[PER_160] and the school discovered in an internal investigation,[ORG_87] said, included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training. The announcement indicates that[ORG_87], the parent company of[ORG_90], knew of[PER_160]'s battle with depression, allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit.[ORG_87], whose CEO[PER_161] previously said[PER_160] was 100% fit to fly, described its statement Tuesday as a "swift and seamless clarification" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors.[PER_162] traveled to the crash site Wednesday, where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered arecover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside. He saw the crisis center set up in[LOC_107], laid a wreath in the village of[LOC_108], closer to the crash site, where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial.[PER_157] told[ORG_10] late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching.[MISC_51] President[PER_163], speaking Tuesday, said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week, sooner than authorities had previously suggested. In the meantime, the recovery of the victims' personal belongings will start Wednesday,[PER_157] said. Among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board. Check out the latest from our correspondents . The details about[PER_160]'s correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into wopments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and[PER_160]'s possible motive for downing the jet. A[ORG_87] spokesperson told[ORG_10] on Tuesday that[PER_160] had a valid medical certificate, had passed all his examinations and "held all the licenses required." Earlier, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in[LOC_109],[PER_164], said medical records reveal[PER_160] suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot's license.[PER_165] emphasized there's no evidence suggesting[PER_160] was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash. Investigators are looking into whether[PER_160] feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license, a[MISC_55] government official briefed on the investigation told[ORG_10] on Tuesday. While flying was "a big part of his life," the source said, it's only one theory being considered. Another source, a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, also toent official briefed on the investigation, also told[ORG_10] that authorities believe the primary motive for[PER_160] to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems.[PER_160]'s girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist, both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues, the[MISC_55] government official said. But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles, there's more to the story, said[PER_166], a forensic psychologist. "Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal," he said. "But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems."[ORG_90] crash compensation: What's problems[PER_31]" Germanwings crash compensation: What we know [PER_31] Who was the captain of Germanwings[MISC_54]?[ORG_10]'s[PER_167] reported from[LOC_101] and[PER_168] from[LOC_109], while[PER_169] wrote from[LOC_68][PER_31][ORG_10]'s[PER_170],[PER_171],[PER_172],[PER_173] and[PER_174] contributed to this report[PER_31]

He was a great Dad and a great man of God," said[PER_177]'s daughter-in-law, Donna[PER_177], in a Twitter message.[PER_177]'s life followed an almost Shakespearean arc. He was born in a[LOC_111] farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days. In his autobiography, "[MISC_56]: My Soul's Adventure with God," he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation.

The "passion pits" where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel.[PER_177] was undeterred, and he quickly outgrew the drive-in. He called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a "miracle," though his many mainstream critics had other names for it. His confident, breezy version of[MISC_57]ity -- too breezy, by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed[MISC_57]s who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many[MISC_60] preachers.[PER_177] sold a softer, gentler message, which borrowed heavily, he acknowledged, from the father of the feel-good gospel,[PER_181]. He preached not to convert or condemn people, but to encourage them, a sentiment he called "possibility thinking." People loved it. "Evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people," said[PER_182], a professor of[MISC_57] thought at[ORG_94] in[LOC_113]essor of[MISC_57] thought at[ORG_94] in[LOC_114]. "And[PER_177] was a master at that." "What he got right is that the gospel is good news,"[PER_183] continued. "And he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope." Some of[PER_177]'s favored phrases, though, struck others as cornpone[MISC_57]ity. "Turn your hurt into a halo?" said[PER_184], a professor of[MISC_21] religious history at[ORG_95], citing one such phrase. "That's pretty weak tea." Still,[PER_185] gives[PER_177] some credit. "It may be bad theology, but it's brilliant marketing." In 1970,[PER_177] began broadcasting "Hour of Power," believed to be one of the first, if not the very first, Sunday service to be shown regularly on television. With his genial smile, priestly robes and gray hair, he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed. The show, which ran for decades, reached millions, making[PER_177] a televangelist before the term became tarnished by televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors.[PER_177]'s crowning achievement, at least architecturally, still stands in[LOC_115],[LOC_110], though it is now owned by the[ORG_96].

He appears to be in good shape, physically and mentally .
========================================
[LOC_120],[LOC_121] ([ORG_3])The second mate of the Houston Express probably couldn't believe what he was seeing. Hundreds of miles from land there was a small boat nearby. At first it looked abandoned. It was in bad shape, listing to one side. The crew of the 1,000-foot long container ship thought it was a yacht that had wrecked. Incredibly, as they got closer, they saw there was a man on it, signaling for help. "He was moving, walking around, waving to us and in surprisingly good condition," Capt.[PER_202]us and in surprisingly good condition," Capt.[PER_203] told[ORG_10] by phone Friday. That man,[PER_204], 37, had an amazing story. He'd been drifting on the 35-foot Pearson sailboat for more than two months since leaving[LOC_122],[LOC_123], to fish in the ocean. Just a few days into his trip, a storm capsized his boat and broke his mast. One of his shoulders was broken, too, so he couldn't fix the boat right away. Eventually he was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, but he could make little headway against the currents. "It took so long,"[PER_205] said.  "It moved so slowly." The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to[PER_205]. His father, Frank[PER_205], told[ORG_10]'s[PER_207] that he was expecting his son to look different. "He looked good. Hadn't lost too much weight. He wasn't badly sunburned like I thought he probably would be," he said. Lost at sea for 66 days . After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for[PER_208]val. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for[PER_205].  The weather wouldn't cooperate.

"Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket." Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while[PER_205] learned they were attracted to his laundry, which he would put out to sea for a rinse.

HEADLINE:[PER_216]:[LOC_20] framework agreement on nukes is strong, but opponents will cast doubts on this and try to obscure its facts .
He says the deal would cut uranium stockpile, centrifuges, implement rigorous inspections; it should be judged on merits, not disinformation .
========================================
([ORG_3])The[LOC_2] and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with[LOC_20] in[LOC_130],[LOC_27], on Thursday that limits[LOC_20]'s nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon. Expect pushback anyway, if the recent past is any harbinger. Just last month, in an attempt to head off such an agreement,[ORG_62] Speaker[PER_217] invited[MISC_5] Prime Minister[PER_4] to preemptively blast it before[ORG_60], and 47 senators sent a letter to the[LOC_20]ian leadership warning them away from a deal. The debateadership warning them away from a deal. The debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light. It will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions. Let us address some of these: . The most misleading assertion, despite universal rejection by experts, is that the negotiations' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in[LOC_131] That is the position of[PER_218] and his acolytes in the U.S.[ORG_60]. But that is not and never was the objective. If it had been, there would have been no[MISC_6] team at the negotiating table. Rather, the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that[LOC_20] could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the[LOC_2] and its allies could respond. The new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal. It would reduce[LOC_20]'s low-enriched uranium stockpile, cut by two-thirds its number of instum stockpile, cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime[LOC_16] Another dubious assumption of opponents is that the[MISC_6] nuclear program is a covert weapons program[LOC_16] Despite sharp accusations by some in the[LOC_2] and its allies,[LOC_20] denies having such a program, and[LOC_18][LOC_16]S[LOC_16] intelligence contends that[LOC_20] has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon[LOC_16][LOC_20]'s continued cooperation with[ORG_104] inspections is further evidence on this point, and we'll know even more about[LOC_20]'s program in the coming months and years because of the deal[LOC_16] In fact, the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the[MISC_6]s[LOC_16] What's more, the rhetoric of some members of[ORG_60] has implied that the negotiations have been between only the[LOC_2] and[LOC_20] (i[LOC_16]e[LOC_16], the 47 senators' letter warning that a deal might be killed by[ORG_60] or a future president)[LOC_16] This of cours by[ORG_60] or a future president)[ORG_105] This of course is not the case[ORG_105] The talks were between[LOC_20] and the five permanent members of the U[ORG_105]N[ORG_105] Security Council ([LOC_133],[LOC_134],[LOC_103],[LOC_45] and[LOC_135]) plus[LOC_82], dubbed the P5+1[ORG_105] While the [LOC_133] has played a leading role in the effort, it negotiated the terms alongside its partners[ORG_105] If the agreement reached by the P5+1 is rejected by[ORG_60], it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on[LOC_20] and threaten[ORG_107] cohesion in other areas[ORG_105] Another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause, after which[LOC_20] will be free to do as it pleases[ORG_105] Again, this is not the case[ORG_105] Some of the restrictions on[LOC_20]'s nuclear activities, such as uranium enrichment, will be eased or eliminated over time, as long as 15 years[ORG_105] But most importantly, the framework agreement includes[LOC_20]'s ratification of the[MISC_65], which allows[ORG_108] inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared[ORG_105] Thio nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared[ORG_105] This provision will be permanent[ORG_105] It does not sunset[ORG_105] Thus, going forward, if[LOC_20] decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels, monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the[ORG_109][ORG_105][ORG_110][ORG_105] Security Council[ORG_105] Many in[ORG_60] have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the[ORG_63] to "advise and consent[ORG_105]" But the issue is not suited for a treaty[ORG_105] Treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories[ORG_105] For example, the [ORG_110]ew START treaty limits[LOC_135] and the[ORG_109]nited States to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads[ORG_105] But any agreement with[LOC_20] will not be so balanced[ORG_105]  The restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on[LOC_20][ORG_105] The P5+1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions, which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal[ORG_105] Finally some insist that any agreement must address[LOC_20]ian missile programs, human rights violations[MISC_6] missile programs, human rights violations or support for[ORG_8] or[ORG_112].  As important as these issues are, and they must indeed be addressed, they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal: preventing a nuclear[LOC_20].  To include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill. This agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies, including[LOC_6]. Those judgments should be fact-based, not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions.

Tourists will now have to ask for a glass of water at a[LOC_110] restaurant .
Perhaps the only good thing is ornia restaurant .
Perhaps the only good thing is another "great" wine grape harvest last year .
========================================
[LOC_136] ([ORG_3])It's more than just one state's internal problem. The historic[LOC_110] drought hurts the rest of the union, too. That's because[LOC_110] is a breadbasket to the nation, growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts. Here's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state, a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted Gov.[PER_219] to announce a mandatory 25% cutback in water consumption in all cities. In 2014, one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the[LOC_110] drought. He was often right, according to statistics gathered by[PER_220], agribusiness professor at[ORG_113]. Prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table: . • Berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $3ose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $3.88 . • Broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $1.89. • Grapes by 64 cents a pound to $3.06 . • Melons by 24 cents a pound to $1.23. • Packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $2.91. • Peppers by 26 cents a pound to $2.39. Though fruits and vegetable prices fell in February, overall prices are expected to rise this year, because of inflation,[ORG_109].[ORG_114].[ORG_115] economist[PER_221] said. Fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5% and 3.5%, and vegetables between 2% and 3%, close to historical average increases,[PER_222] said. Whether the[LOC_110] drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown, thanks to a strong dollar. The greenback's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of[LOC_137] rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation,[PER_222] said. Moreover, the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from[LOC_110] to the other 49 states, she said. What economists do the other 49 states, she said. What economists don't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought. Those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices, she said. "The drought in[LOC_110] does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter,"[PER_222] said. "We are not sure what the exact impact will be." The reality is there's a major drought throughout the[LOC_138] and[LOC_139]. While not as bad as[LOC_110],[LOC_88] and[LOC_140] are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states, the U.S. Drought Monitor said this week. Overall, the[LOC_138]ern drought affects more than 52 million people, the monitor says. As a result, consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1% for beef and veal in 2014, the[ORG_116] reports. Straining under a drought that began in 2012, ranchers in[LOC_88] and[LOC_140] last year saw smaller grazing pastures, [LOC_140] last year saw smaller grazing pastures, paid more for feed, and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle. So the cattlemen began culling their herds,[PER_222] said. This year's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6% at most, still higher than the 4.1% historical average, the feds project. But beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought. "There's other areas being affected,"[PER_222] said. It's called the[LOC_141] for the gold rush of yore, but let's face it: the rest of the nation flocks to[LOC_110] for vacation because of another golden reason. Its year-round sunshine. So the next time you take a holiday in[LOC_110], you'll find a few changes around here, thanks to the drought. Like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant. You won't find water waiting for you on the table. Eateries now "can only serve water to customers on request," the[ORG_117] declared in March under expanded emergency regulations. Tourists can also expect to heagency regulations. Tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily. These requests are mandatory under the new regulations. And they'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains. Because much of the snowpack in the[LOC_142] has alarmingly disappeared, many ski resorts shut down early this year, including at[LOC_143], and some are now building zip lines, mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming, the[ORG_118] reported. "If the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more, the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are,"[ORG_119] Chair[PER_223] said in March. But what about those yummy[LOC_110] wines, you ask? Guess what. They're only getting better -- because of the drought. Yes, you read that right. The 2014 wine grape harvest was "third in a string of great vintages this decade," the[ORG_120] says. "[LOC_144] vintners and groweine Institute says. "[LOC_144] vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage, despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south[LOC_145] in late August just as crush was getting underway," the institute said in a statement last year. "A mild winter and spring caused early bud break, although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years." Wine grapes use relatively low water, said institute spokeswoman[PER_224]. "Yes, drought years tend to produce terrific quality," she added. "With the record high [LOC_144] wine grape harvests in 2012, 2013 and 2014, there is a good supply of [LOC_144] wine." That may be the only thing to toast about this drought.

========================================
([ORG_3])Since[LOC_20]'s[MISC_69] in 1979, women have been barred from attending most sports events involving men. But the sitding most sports events involving men. But the situation appears set to improve in the coming months after a top[MISC_6] sports official said that the ban will be lifted for some events. A plan to allow "women and families" to enter sports stadiums will come into effect in the next year, Deputy Sports Minister[PER_234] said Saturday, according to state-run media. But it isn't clear exactly which games women will be able to attend. According to the state-run[ORG_126],[PER_235] said the restrictions would be lifted for indoor sports events.

HEADLINE: Going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard .
But where there is the restrictive rule of law, journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom .
From[LOC_45] to[LOC_154], journalists and bloggers have been jailed -- even killed .
===============================d -- even killed .
========================================
([ORG_3])Just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day, online activity -- blogs, YouTube channels, even social media platforms like[ORG_130] and[ORG_131] -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media. It is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence, though that in itself is liberating. It is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online. It is not unique to[LOC_155], but it might seem more pronounced if you live there. Going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard. But it still brings resistance, some of it legal, some of it deadly. Let's look at the legal angle first.[PER_242], the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail Sunday in[LOC_156], drew international attention for his anti-[PER_243] harangue. But jailinion for his[PER_244] harangue. But jailing critics is not usually the government's first choice in[LOC_156]. It is part of[PER_245]'s legacy that the government's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases, usually carrying heavy financial penalties, is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices. His father has reportedly apologized for his son's behavior, but the younger[PER_246] could face up to three years in jail.[PER_246] is not unique. Another dissident blogger in[LOC_156],[PER_247], continues to suffer financial and legal pressure, including the loss of his job, because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city-state's Prime Minister,[PER_248], of corruption.[PER_249]'s concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the[ORG_132], the government's compulsory pension program.[PER_246] and[PER_249] are two of many. The[ORG_133]' file on[LOC_156] going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases, some against phas a long string of similar cases, some against politicians, others against citizens simply frustrated with their government. But it is not just[LOC_156] where[MISC_68] activity comes under fire: On Monday in[LOC_154], with much less of the international attention heaped on[PER_242], five editors and executives from The[LOC_154]n Insider were arrested over the site's March 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors, known as the[ORG_135], had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud, or punishments meted out under[MISC_13] law. In deeply[MISC_74][LOC_154], questions of[MISC_13] faith are a third-rail issue, as is revealing government decisions before they are announced. By far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is[LOC_45], where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers, most of them[MISC_75] or[MISC_76] activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism. But in second place inen journalism and activism. But in second place in[LOC_155] is[LOC_48], where[ORG_136]'s most recent prison census showed[LOC_48] holding 16 reporters behind bars as of December 1. Add one more in late December,[PER_250], a prominent blogger who was arrested for "law-violating" after police searched his home in southern[LOC_157] on December 27, and two more in January,[PER_251] and[PER_252], arrested on anti-state charges of "abusing democratic freedoms" and you can see the pattern. Because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled, mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in[LOC_48]. Only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in[LOC_48], their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013. Both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage. The list could go on, but the reality is that, as[ORG_136] wrote in 2013, across[LOC_155] "governments have curtailed[MISC_68] freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices, including prohibiteasingly restrictive practices, including prohibitive laws, heightened surveillance and censorship, and threats of imprisonment on various national security-related offenses[LOC_16]" That is still the policy path being followed by most countries in[LOC_155], and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon[LOC_16] Jailing journalists is one thing, but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another[LOC_16] Since 1992, 11% of journalists killed have died for their work online[LOC_16] Because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the[MISC_68], that proportion can be expected to grow[LOC_16] While most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers,[LOC_60] has recently become the exception[LOC_16] On Monday,[PER_253] was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in[LOC_60] in the past five weeks[LOC_16] Blogger[PER_254] and his wife,[PER_255], were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting[LOC_158][LOC_16][PER_256], a U[LOC_16]S[LOC_16] citizen of[LOC_60]i origing[LOC_158][LOC_16][PER_256], a[LOC_24] citizen of[MISC_77] origin, was killed and his wife was critically injured[LOC_16] Both[PER_257] and[PER_256] had written critically on[MISC_13] matters[LOC_16] The blogger death toll gets higher in[LOC_60] if you go back a year or two, and religious beliefs are always involved, and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity[LOC_16] In January 2013, blogger[PER_258], who wrote critical commentary on religion,[MISC_78] groups, free speech, and human rights, barely survived after he was stabbed by[MISC_78]s[LOC_16] In February 2013, blogger[PER_259], who had written about[MISC_13] fundamentalism and[MISC_78] groups, was hacked to death by members of an[MISC_78] militant group, according to police investigations[LOC_16] Later in 2013,[MISC_78] groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy[LOC_16] While arrests were made after those murders, there have been no convictions[LOC_16] The bottom line: Online journalists, operating outside the restraints of mainstream media, havng outside the restraints of mainstream media, have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors. Where there is the restrictive rule of law, journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom. Where the rule of law is weak, they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom, if ever, answer to the rule of law.

And a top[MISC_38] said almost any of[PER_192]'s successors as president "could do better."[PER_218]'s most recent argument against the[LOC_20] nuclear deal was similar to the one he'd made in a March trip to[LOC_13], when he add'd made in a March trip to[LOC_13], when he addressed a joint session of[ORG_60] -- fueling a[MISC_38] push to have the deal sent to[ORG_60] before it's implemented. "It does not roll back[LOC_20]'s nuclear program. It keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place. Not a single centrifuge is destroyed. Not a single nuclear facility is shut down, including the underground facilities that they built illicitly. Thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning, enriching uranium,"[PER_218] said Sunday. "That's a very bad deal. "[PER_218] said[LOC_20] is a country of "congenital cheating" and that it can't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal, which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that. He said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with[PER_192]. "I think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this, because I think[LOC_20] has shown to be completely distrustful,"[PER_218] said.[MISC_88] Sen.[PER_283] of[LOC_110], meanwhile, said she wisheFeinstein of[LOC_110], meanwhile, said she wishes[PER_218] "would contain himself."

"It's a framework. It has to be wrapped into a final agreement. There still can be some changes,"[PER_284] said. "But I don't think it's helpful for[LOC_6] to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill, a downhill dynamic in this part of the world." Energy Secretary[PER_285] defended the deal in an appearance on[ORG_142]' "Face the Nation" on Sunday, saying it would extend from two months to one year the "breakout" time period -- the length of time it would take[LOC_20] to build a nuclear bomb. He said it also allows for the "almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal." "We have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb,""We have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb," he said[LOC_16] Sen[LOC_16][PER_286],[MISC_89]-[LOC_166], said on "Face the Nation" that the best option for the[LOC_2] is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a "new crack at it with a new president that doesn't have the baggage of[PER_192][LOC_16]" And he said the alternatives to[PER_192] on both sides -- with the exception of Sen[LOC_16][MISC_89]and Paul of[LOC_41], who's called for a less active[LOC_24] role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal[LOC_16] "[PER_288] would do better[LOC_16] I think everybody on our side, except, maybe,[MISC_89]and Paul, could do better,"[PER_289] said[LOC_16]

========================================
([ORG_3])Standing up for what you believe. What does it cost you? What do you gain?[ORG_143] in the[LOC_83] town of[LOC_167] is finding out. The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's[MISC_90] after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding. "If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no,"[PER_290] told [ORG_3] affiliate[ORG_144]-TV in[LOC_168]. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than $842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern[LOC_83] knew existed before olks outside northern[LOC_83] knew existed before this week.[PER_291] tweeted: "Dear #[ORG_145]. No. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion." "Don't threaten #[ORG_145]" tweeted[PER_292]. "Just mock them for their ignorance." Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food.  Many too vulgar to share. "Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens? BOYCOTT[ORG_143]!!" said[PER_293] of[LOC_83]polis.  "Let's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business." Anti-bigotry critics harass wrong pizzeria . But one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday. "Who's going to[LOC_167] with me to burn down[ORG_143]?"[PER_294] of[LOC_169] tweeted, according to the[LOC_167] Police Dephen tweeted, according to the[ORG_147]. The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted. Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment, intimidation and threats, according to[PER_295], assistant police chief. The mood was a bit more subdued on the streets of[LOC_167]. A man stood outside[ORG_148] holding a sign that reads "bigots."[PER_296] bought $100 of pizza from another shop down the street and started handing it out,[ORG_144] reported. "Do you want some non-discriminatory pizza?"[PER_297] asked. But for every tweet and Facebook post taking[ORG_143] to task were words of support and a groundswell of financial support. "Because nothing says tolerance like threatening to kill[MISC_59] & burn down their businesses," said a tweet from[PER_298]. "What's happening to #[ORG_145] isn't the free market, it's a lynch mob," tweeted[PER_299]. "Cyber bulling isn't the same as taking your business elsewhere." Supporters rallied to a[MISC_91] pass elsewhere." Supporters rallied to a[MISC_91] page in support of[ORG_143]. By the time the fundraiser ended late Friday, $842,387 had been raised.

(CNN)Police in the[MISC_92] city of[LOC_170], in the western state of[LOC_171], are requiring identity cards for an unusual group of residents: Cattle. Following a recent state-wide ban on the sale and consumption of beef, authorities in the city have asked residents to take a 'mugshot' of their cattle and submit it to the police. Along with the photograph, the residents have to give information about their animal's 'unique features,' such as the coloring and age of the cow, along with the length of its tail and other distinctive characteristics. Poits tail and other distinctive characteristics. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law. Cows are considered holy and revered by that state's majority[MISC_93] population. "We are creating a database.

"I believe this will be very effective" So far over 100 owners have complied with the police order and more are lining up outside police stations across the city to get their livestock photographed. The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in[LOC_170], where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat.

An[LOC_174] man says he drifted from[LOC_175] to[LOC_176] over a year [ORG_105]
========================================
([ORG_3])It's the kind of thing you see in movies, like[PER_307]'s role in "[MISC_96]" or[PER_308]'s "[MISC_97][ORG_105]" But, in real life, it's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days, weeks, if not months and somehow living to talk about it[ORG_105] Miracles do happen, though, and not just in[LOC_75][ORG_105] We're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the[ORG_109][ORG_105]S[ORG_105] Coast Guard[ORG_105] Much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they ividuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they'd brought aboard, if any. In order to survive, they can't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city, town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity, resourcefulness and luck. It's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly, with a sailor dying at sea, except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues. Such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says, a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts. Below are a few recent examples: .[PER_204] says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from[LOC_123] in late January. He headed into the[LOC_177] looking for a good spot to catch fish. And then everything -- his boat, his life -- turned upside down. Rescued man says he is 'utterly thankful' Not only did his boat capsize, but its mast broke,[PER_205] said his boat capsize, but its mast broke,[PER_205] said. And so, too, did his shoulder. He bought time by rationing water, then collecting fresh water in a bucket. As to food,[PER_205] says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish. And he rigged a makeshift mast and sail. But,[PER_205] said, "It took so long. It moved so slowly." His sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a[MISC_98] container ship, the Houston Express, spotted[PER_205] about 200 miles off the[LOC_39] coast on Thursday. After their reunion, his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads. "I thought I lost you."[PER_309] says his journey began in[LOC_178], a port on[LOC_175]'s[LOC_179] coast, in late 2012. The exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in December, locals say it was November. But what's not in doubt is that, after he left, he disappeared. Until January 2013. That's when[PER_310] interacted with humans once again, thousands of miles away on a remote atolce again, thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the[LOC_176].[PER_311] recounts how he survived over a year adrift in[LOC_179] . What was supposed to be a one-day trip, he says, turned into an arduous odyssey across the[LOC_179] Ocean, one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive. His nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course. Then a storm hit causing their boat, which was about three people long and one wide, to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and GPS systems. Four weeks in,[PER_310] said his partner -- 23-year-old[PER_312], according to the boat's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds. The days, weeks and months ran together after that.[PER_310] says he drank rainwater and, when there wasn't any available, his own urine. He ate sea turtles. Then, after 13 or 14 months adrift, he and his small, heavily damaged boat arrived on the[LOC_180], about a 22-hour boat ride from the[LOC_176] capital of ur boat ride from the[LOC_176] capital of[LOC_181]. The atoll has one phone line, no[MISC_68] service and a few residents, two of whom[PER_310] spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods. The[LOC_174] native told[ORG_10] that his faith in[PER_313] helped him survive. "I thought, 'I am going to get out," he said. "Get out, get out, get out." Some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement, reining it in a few notches as life slows down. And if you live in[LOC_182], there's even more reason to take it easy. The thing is:[PER_314] isn't one of those people. He's a fisherman. The sea is both his life and livelihood, his son,[PER_315], told[ORG_10]. And he's tough, with his son jokingly comparing him to[PER_316]. Still, even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what[PER_314] went through after setting off around last Thanksgiving solo from the[LOC_182]an island of[LOC_183]. Son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea . After bad weather hit,[PER_314] told[ORG_10] affiliate Kbad weather hit,[PER_314] told[ORG_10] affiliate[ORG_151] that his 25-foot sailboat went "backwards all night long." At one point, a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well. The 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in. But his boat couldn't be rescued so easily, leaving him at the mercy of the current. A distress call went out, prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles. When a[ORG_101] official told him the search was being called off December 1,[PER_317] responded, "I don't feel like he's dead. I don't feel it." He was right. Twelve days after that first distress call,[PER_314] was picked up about 64 miles (103 kilometers) south of[LOC_184] "weak, hungry and dehydrated" and -- most importantly -- alive. The veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him. In February 2012, two friends asked 18-year-old[PER_318] whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition. He stag along on an overnight fishing expedition. He said yes, and the three set off from the[LOC_185] town of[LOC_186] on a small boat,[PER_319]'s mother,[PER_320], recalled. Things started out well, by all accounts. The three caught plenty of fish. Then, their boat's engine died without warning. And, with no tools and scant navigational experience, the trio didn't know what to do, according to[PER_319]'s mother. Mother calls[LOC_185] teen's return 'a miracle'[PER_321] ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat, the Fifty Cents, further and further from the coast and into the[LOC_65]. Somewhere along the way, his two companions died. It's not clear exactly how, with[MISC_100] Rear. Adm.[PER_322] saying[PER_319] threw their bodies into the sea "because they had become badly decomposed." Some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began, fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the[LOC_187]. The[MISC_100] navy came in and picked up the teenage[MISC_100] navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor, who'd lost 20 pounds and showed "severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition," according to[PER_323]. He returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him, but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal. "For us, this is an opportunity to get closer as a family," his mother said by phone, "to be more understanding and loving." Sometimes one doesn't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled. Sometimes people don't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end.

========================================
([ORG_3])The world's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this. The[ORG_155] ([ORG_156]), a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world, is ready for action following a two[ORG_157]year shutdown. After problems that delayed the restart in March, scientists at the[ORG_158] ([ORG_159]) completed final tests, enabling the first beams to start circulating Sunday inside the [ORG_156]'s 17 mile (27 km) ring. "Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what [ORG_159]'s here for," [ORG_159] Director[ORG_157]General[PER_326] said on the organization's website. "Today, [ORG_159]'s heart beats once more to the rhythm ooday,[ORG_161]'s heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC." The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second, with a beam circulating for 10 hours, traveling more than 6 billion miles (more than 10 billion kilometers) -- the distance from[LOC_190] to[LOC_191] and back again. At near light-speed, a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second. It took thousands of scientists, engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator, housed in a tunnel between[LOC_192] and the[LOC_193] mountain range. The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the "[MISC_101]" -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe. By replicating the energy density and temperature, scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved. Our current, limited, knowledge is based on what's called[MISC_102] of particle physics.  "But we know that this model is not complete," Dr.[PER_327], operations group leader at the LHC, told [PER_328], operations group leader at the LHC, told[ORG_10] in March. The burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy, while others have no mass at all; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy, since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe. The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter, despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the[MISC_103].[ORG_161] says the energies achievable by the LHC have only ever been found in nature. The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros (about $3.3 billion), paid for by member countries of[ORG_161] and contributions by non-member nations. The organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by[MISC_104] and[MISC_51] laws and a[MISC_105]. Scientists and physics enthusiastuncil Directive. Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown. "After two years of effort, the LHC is in great shape," said[ORG_161] Director for Accelerators and Technology,[PER_329]. "But the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels."[PER_330] contributed to this report.

The attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group's activities, and a clear indicator that the security situation in[LOC_205] is deteriorating fast.[MISC_110][ORG_167] has been behind a string of recent attacks in[LOC_206], the most well-known of them being the massacre at the[LOC_207] in[LOC_208] in 2013. Cthe[LOC_207] in[LOC_208] in 2013[ORG_105] Cross-border raids into[LOC_206] by the group, however, date back to 2011[ORG_105][ORG_167] incursions triggered a military response by the government in[LOC_208], which sent troops to[LOC_99] as part of an[ORG_170] mission in support of[LOC_99]'s internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from[ORG_167] and other militants for several years[ORG_105][ORG_167] is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the[MISC_111] as[ORG_171] and[ORG_123] (also known as[ORG_172]), but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support[ORG_105] Its origins lie in[ORG_173] ([ORG_174]), one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of[PER_340] in 1991[ORG_105] These disparate groups fought each other and a U[ORG_105]N[ORG_105] peacekeeping mission in the[MISC_112] civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country, from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later[ORG_105][ORG_167] (literally "[ORG_176]"a century later.[ORG_167] (literally "[ORG_176]") split from[ORG_177] in 2003 and merged with another radical[MISC_78] group, the so[ORG_157]called[ORG_178]. As their alliance obtained control of[LOC_99]'s capital[LOC_209] in 2006,[LOC_210], the only majority[MISC_57] country in the region, took military action against the group. The offensive weakened[ORG_167] and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern[LOC_99], but it failed to defeat it. To the contrary,[LOC_210]'s invasion and occupation of parts of[LOC_99] [ORG_157][ORG_157] although invited by the[MISC_112] government and backed by the[ORG_170] [ORG_157][ORG_157] enabled[ORG_167] to partially re[ORG_157]invent itself as both an[MISC_78] and nationalist force opposing a foreign "[MISC_113]" invasion. Initially, the group primarily attacked[LOC_210]n forces, but soon began to "expand" its activities against the[MISC_112] government as well. The first attack outside[LOC_99] was an attack in the[MISC_115] capital of[LOC_211] in 2010. Soon after this, cross[ORG_157]border of[LOC_211] in 2010. Soon after this, cross-border raids in[LOC_206] began, predominantly targeting[MISC_59] there. Increasing its links with[ORG_171],[ORG_167] declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to[ORG_123]. Much will depend on how the relationships between[ORG_171] in the Arabian Peninsula ([ORG_180]), a long-time ally of[ORG_167] based in[LOC_212], and[ORG_123] develop. The key point is that[ORG_167]'s attack in[LOC_213] is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors. It must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden-variety fundamentalist terrorism. Clearly, the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern, and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of[MISC_116]. But the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems: from economic development challenges to environmental degradation; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance. These entrenched inequalities help[ORG_167] appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits, who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons. Attacking a university in northern[LOC_206] and separating[MISC_57] from[MISC_74] students epitomizes the way[ORG_167] advances itself by exploiting religious, tribal and nationalist identities. Ultimately, though, this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people, over territory, and over resources. As long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political, economic, and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self-interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests. It is important to counter[ORG_167] directly, including by military meaner[ORG_167] directly, including by military means. But there won't be any lasting solution to the wider region's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by[ORG_167]. As[PER_341] shows, these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit. Copyright 2015[ORG_181]. Some rights reserved.

HEADLINE:[MISC_117] is a key event in the[MISC_57] faith, but where did the[MISC_117] Bunny come from?
Why is the date different every year, and what does it have to do with the moon?
========================================
([ORG_3])[MISC_118] is a cornerstone event in the[MISC_57] faith, but it's surroutone event in the[MISC_57] faith, but it's surrounded by interesting quirks. It celebrates the completion of[PER_342]'s mission of salvation in the Crucifixion and Resurrection. By dying on Good Friday,[PER_342] atoned for the sins of others; by rising from the grave on Sunday,[PER_342] conquered death. Simple enough and reason for[MISC_57]s to celebrate. But, like[PER_342]mas with its tree, ornaments and[PER_343],[MISC_117] has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs.  Unlike[PER_342]mas, it doesn't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events. And that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around[MISC_117]? (No.) Here's a journey from the[LOC_214] to the[LOC_215], around the moon and the Earth's tilting axis, to[LOC_82] and the[LOC_2] to try to explain the complex holiday called[MISC_117]. And you'll learn to how to color[MISC_117] eggs with Kool-Aid. Let's start at the[LOC_214]. At the[LOC_214],[MISC_120] began with[MISC_121]an. At the[LOC_214],[MISC_120] began with Palm Sunday last week and culminated in[MISC_122] with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of[PER_342]'s mortal life.[PER_344] rode on the back of a donkey into[LOC_216] on Palm Sunday where crowds celebrated him as the[PER_345] and laid down palm branches in his path. But the crowd and the[MISC_123] turned on him in the course of the week, according to the[MISC_124], leading to his crucifixion and resurrection. Rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray[LOC_217].[LOC_218] on Sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by[PER_346]. Afterward, the Pontiff took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his[MISC_125] address.[PER_347] lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe. From[LOC_50] to[LOC_219],[LOC_57] to[LOC_220], he expressed hope that violence would end.[PER_347] also doesn't put on airs. This week he washed the feet of believers, repeatingis week he washed the feet of believers, repeating the[MISC_126] account of a woman, a sinner, washing[PER_344]' feet and anointing them with oil. Let's move on to old[LOC_216], the birthplace of[MISC_117]. The[LOC_221] in old[LOC_216] unifies the spot where[PER_342] was crucified --[LOC_222] -- with his tomb, or sepulcher. On Sunday,[MISC_127] and Armenian[PER_342]ians celebrated the[MISC_129] there. In the morning, the[MISC_130] Patriarch, the Archbishop of[LOC_216], entered the basilica. Then mass was held followed by a procession. But a large group of indigenous[PER_342]ians didn't join them. It's not quite[MISC_117] yet in the[LOC_215] for[MISC_117]n Orthodox[PER_342]ians. They'll be celebrating a week from now, because they determine[MISC_117]'s date by a different calendar than Western[PER_342]ians -- the[MISC_133] calendar. Which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of[MISC_117] Sunday. A blood moon appeared in the sky early Saturday, right between[MISC_134] and[MISC_117] Sundaturday, right between[MISC_134] and[MISC_117] Sunday and during[MISC_135]. Just a coincidence? Not completely, because the dates for both[MISC_135] -- the[MISC_32] holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in[LOC_49] -- and[MISC_117] are determined by moon phases, according to timeanddate.com.[MISC_117]'s timing is related to[MISC_135], because[PER_344] was crucified around then, according to the[MISC_124]. Many[MISC_32] holidays, including[MISC_135], fall on full moon, which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse, the event that turns the moon a blood red color. Since the timing of moon phases doesn't jibe with Earth's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now --[MISC_135]'s exact date moves around -- and so does[MISC_117]'s. When[MISC_57] bishops first convened at the Council of Nicaea in the year 325, they made a rule to determine the date of[MISC_117], so as to fairly reliably pin it to[MISC_135]: . It would fall on the first Sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox. That's the day in n following the vernal equinox. That's the day in March when Earth's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length. But ... if the full moon fell on Sunday,[MISC_117] would be pushed down a week. Confusing? It got worse. When the West moved from the[MISC_133] calendar to the[MISC_136] calendar,[MISC_137] stayed put, resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for[MISC_117]. In 1997, the[ORG_182] pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences. It didn't catch on. But some odd[MISC_117] trappings that popped up after the[MISC_138] very much have -- the eggs and the bunny. The bunny is an egg-laying pagan that worships the moon. That's one notion of its origins, but probably not the actual one.[MISC_53] immigrants appear to have brought it to[LOC_201] in the 1700s.[MISC_53] historians are not clear on its beginnings, but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682. Professor of medithe eggs in writing was in 1682. Professor of medicine[PER_348] described in his paper "[MISC_139]," or "On[MISC_140]," a custom in the[LOC_223] region involving a bunny and eggs, according to[MISC_53] public television. Some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the[MISC_119] tree. But[PER_349] left out any explanation of how the tradition arose, leading to a number of theories in[MISC_53]y. One common idea: During[MISC_141], people had to abstain from eating eggs, but hens kept on laying them, so farmers boiled and preserved them. By the time[MISC_117] rolled around, they were practically swimming in them. They had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit. Play hide and seek with them; color them; give them as gifts. Parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the[MISC_140] came from. If you're coloring eggs this year, here's an interesting tip.  Instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar, use Koog up your place with the smell of vinegar, use[MISC_142], YouTube science geek[PER_350] suggests. And it appears to work. Just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in. They turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye. But be careful, it stains everything else, like clothes and upholstery,[PER_351] warns. That's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it. Happy[MISC_117]! Happy[MISC_135]!

HEADLINE: In response to lawsuit,[ORG_71] says it doesn't control quality of education for student-athletes .
But its website emphasizes importance of education, "opportunities to learn"
Lawsuit claims students didn't get an education because of academic fraud at[ORG_183] .
========================================
(t[ORG_183] .
========================================
(CNN)After years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount, the[ORG_71] now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered. On its website, the[ORG_71] prominently states, "It's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn, play and succeed." And later, it says that "in the collegiate model of sports, the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first, athletes second." But the[ORG_71] is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former[ORG_184] athletes. The lawsuit claimed the students didn't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in[ORG_71] history. In its response, the[ORG_71] says it has no legal responsibility "to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student-athletes at its member institutions." Even with pages of online information aboutions." Even with pages of online information about academic standards, and even though the[ORG_71] has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly,[ORG_71] attorneys wrote in this court filing that "the[ORG_71] did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student-athletes," and "the[ORG_71] does not have 'direct, day-to-day, operational control' " over member institutions like[ORG_183]. "It's nonsense. It's double talk," said[PER_352], a former athletic-academic director who is now president of[ORG_185] for academic integrity in collegiate sport. "If you look at their basic core principles, it's all about academics, the experience, the integration of academics, and the education of the student is paramount,"[PER_353] said. "They seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths." The[ORG_71] referred calls for comment to an online statement, which read in part: . The[ORG_71] believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the[ORG_71]'s role with respect to its member stands the[ORG_71]'s role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the[ORG_71] has taken to assist student-athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field. "This case is troubling for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the[ORG_71] to ensure that every student-athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them," said[PER_354],[ORG_71] chief legal officer. In its response to the lawsuit, it also likened its role to that of the[ORG_186] or[ORG_187], and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately. The scandal at[ORG_183] involved thousands of athletes who, over 18 years, were funneled into classes that never met, where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports.[PER_355], the[ORG_183] whistleb to play sports.[PER_355], the[ORG_183] whistleblower turned[ORG_71] critic, has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required. The system of eligibility that the[ORG_71] brags about, she says, is a sham. "Why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we can't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway? It makes no sense," said[PER_356], who recently wrote a book about the[ORG_183] scandal called "Cheated." "If they can't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that, then why certify students semester after semester to play? It's lost its meaning for me." The[ORG_71]'s claim that it's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years, not just in the rhetoric on its website, but in speeches by its president,[PER_357], and in court defending itself front,[PER_357], and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes. For example, before it lost a case filed by former[ORG_188] player[PER_358], suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses, the[ORG_71] stood on the pillar of amateurism, insisting that college athletes are paid with an education. That's the defense the[ORG_71] is now using in another class action filed by big-time sports attorney[PER_359], seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value. In response, the[ORG_71] said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education: Consistent with "its commitment to amateurism, member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with[ORG_71] bylaws." Attorney[PER_360], who represented both[PER_361] and now the[ORG_183] athletes, said this: . "This startling inconsistenathletes, said this: . "This startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the[ORG_71]'s shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes.[ORG_71] President[PER_357] has repeatedly proposed that 'What we live for is the education of our athletes,' but the[ORG_71]'s record tells a far different story." But[PER_362], professor of sport management at[ORG_189], said it's not realistic to think that the[ORG_71] would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country. "I understand, I think, where the[ORG_71] is coming from. We would not let the[ORG_71] come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at[ORG_189]," he said. "It sounds like someone is trying to say the[ORG_71] should have been supervising that department at the[ORG_184], and there's no logic to that," he said. "The people who are saying the[ORG_71] should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an oppoemics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the[ORG_71]."[ORG_183], which was also sued, has admitted to the fraud, but also asked for a judge to throw out the case, saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the "educational malpractice" theory doesn't apply.[ORG_183] claims it is protected by state law. This is reminiscent of another[ORG_71] reversal. The[ORG_71], which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from "dangerous and exploitive athletic practices," now says it does not enforce health and safety rules. In fact, in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011, the[ORG_71] wrote: "The[ORG_71] denies that it has a legal duty to protect student-athletes." A[ORG_10] investigation found that the[ORG_71] has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken. It has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the NFL.[PER_363], president of the[ORG_190], aent of the[ORG_190], and a leading thorn in the[ORG_71]'s side for decades, said this latest backpedaling from the[ORG_71] leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all[PER_31] "There's nothing left the[ORG_71] can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society[PER_31] One has to wonder what does the[ORG_71] do if it doesn't protect players? If it doesn't play a role in the education of college athletics? It begs the question of why does the[ORG_71] exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption[PER_31]"

"[MI[LOC_227]C_149]" logs a 13th week atop the[MI[LOC_227]C_156] chart with 165,000 downloads sold (down 12 percent) in the week ending March 29, according to[ORG_201].  That's a record-tying feat: "[MI[LOC_227]C_149]!" matches[PER_393]'s 2007-08 hit "[MI[LOC_227]C_158]," featuring[PER_394], for the most weeks a title has spent at No. 1 on[MI[LOC_227]C_156]. "[MI[LOC_227]C_149]" also leads[MI[LOC_227]C_159] (16.2 million[LOC_18].[LOC_227]. streams, down 15 percent) for an 11th week. On Radio [LOC_227]ongs, "[MI[LOC_227]C_149]" reigns for a 10th week with 166 million in all-format audience (down 4 percent). It's the first song to reach double-digit weeks at No. 1 on Radio [LOC_227]on to reach double-digit weeks at No. 1 on[MISC_160] since "[MISC_143]" led for 11. Ask[ORG_200]: Will '[MISC_155] Be the[MISC_147]'s No. 1 Song of 2015? "[MISC_149]," thus, leads the[MISC_147] and its three main component charts ([MISC_162],[MISC_160] and[MISC_159]) simultaneously for a record-extending ninth week (nonconsecutively). Perhaps helping the chances that "[MISC_149]" can remain at No. 1 on the[MISC_147], at least for another week: while it's down by 11 percent in overall activity, the No. 2 song (for a third week),[ORG_202]'s "[MISC_163]," decreases by 3 percent, while[PER_395]'s "[MISC_164]," at No. 3 (for a third week, after peaking at No. 2 for eight weeks), is off by 2 percent. And, the lead of "[MISC_149]" over those songs is still significant: they each boast approximately two-thirds of the[MISC_147] points of "[MISC_149]" this week. Could either "[MISC_163]" or "[MISC_165]" rebound to challenge "[MISC_149]" further on the[MISC_147]? Could another song in the top 10 topple it? Or, is it a song just building, or not eveple it? Or, is it a song just building, or not even yet released, that will take over? Again, it's too soon to tell. We know only that a song will eventually dethrone the uncommonly overarching smash that "[MISC_149]" has become. (At least we think one will ...) Chart Highlights:[PER_33]'s '[MISC_166]' hits No. 1 on adult pop songs . Meanwhile, "[MISC_163]" takes over at No. 1 on the subscription services-based[MISC_167] chart, despite a 10 percent drop to 4.1 million streams. ("[MISC_149]" falls to No. 3 on the list after 11 weeks at No. 1.) "[MISC_163]" holds at No. 2 on[MISC_156] (143,000, down 8 percent); rises 4-2 on[MISC_160] (133 million, up 3 percent); and keeps at No. 4 on[MISC_159] (9.5 million, down 4 percent). Below[PER_396],[PER_397]'s "Love Me Like You Do" holds at No. 4 on the[MISC_147] after reaching No. 3.

From the same hit movie,[PER_398]'s "[MISC_169] ([MISC_170])" reaches the[MISC_147]'s top five (6-5), adding top Airplay Gainer honors for a second week.

The rapper's new EP, My House, arrives Tuesday (April 7). One song is new to the[MISC_147]'s top 10:[PER_404]'s "Somebody," featuring[PER_405] (13-10).

And,[PER_387] roars in at No. 23 with "B**** Better Have My Money," the chart's highest debut, powered largely by its No. 5 debut on[MISC_156] (108,000 sold since its digital retail arrival on March 26).

([ORG_3])A high temperature of 63.5 degrees Fahrenheit might sound like a pleasant day in early spring -- unless you're in[LOC_229]. The chilly continent recorded the temperature (15.5 degrees[MISC_180]) on March 24, possibly the highest ever recorded on[LOC_229], according to the[ORG_205]. The temperature was recorded at[LOC_230]'s[LOC_231] on the northern tip of the[LOC_228], according to [ORG_3] affiliate[ORG_206]. (Note to map lovers: The[MISC_181] base is not geographically part of the[MISC_182] continent.) The[ORG_204], a specialized[ORG_24] agency, is in the process of setting up an international ad-hoc committee of about 10 blue-ribbon climatologists and meteorologists to begin collecting relevant evidence, said[PER_408]n collecting relevant evidence, said[PER_408], the agency's lead rapporteur of weather and climate extremes and[ORG_113] professor of geographical sciences. The committee will examine the equipment used to measure the temperature, whether it was in good working order, whether the correct monitoring procedures were followed, whether the equipment was placed in the correct location and whether the measurement is matched by corresponding records from surrounding stations,[PER_409] said. The committee will discuss the issues and make a recommendation to[PER_409], who will make an official finding, probably by late summer or early fall.

========================================
(CNN)The[LOC_2] has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion, especially in[LOC_83], where its new[MISC_90] faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people[MISC_185] Such state laws have been growing ever since the[MISC_186][MISC_185]S[MISC_185][MISC_90] became law in 1993, designed to prohibit the federal government from "substantially burdening" a person's exercise of religion[MISC_185] So far, 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law, and the legal controversies have gro liberty law, and the legal controversies have grown, too. Nonetheless, claims under those state[MISC_188] are "exceedingly rare," and victories involved mostly religious minorities, not[MISC_57] denominations, experts say. "There is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers," wrote[ORG_208] law professor[PER_410] in a 2010 analysis, when there were only 16 states with such laws. Here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws, touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an[ORG_207] accountant to a tea from the[LOC_233]: . He was a[MISC_183] with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes. But not in the eyes of the feds. In 2006,[PER_411] and[PER_412] attended an[MISC_189] powwow while in possession of eagle feathers, in violation of the federal[MISC_190], which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles anh outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground[ORG_105][PER_413], a[MISC_191], asserted he was participating in an[MISC_92] religious ceremony[ORG_105] The feathers are sacred to[MISC_192][ORG_105] But a federal[ORG_209] agent found his tribe wasn't federally recognized, and[PER_413] surrendered his feathers[ORG_105][PER_414], who is married to[PER_413]'s sister, isn't American[MISC_92] and agreed to pay a fine, according to court papers and the[ORG_210][ORG_105][PER_413], however, petitioned the federal[ORG_211] to return his feathers[ORG_105] The feds said no, because he wasn't from a recognized tribe[ORG_105][PER_413] and[PER_414] sued the federal government, but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government, rejecting the two men's[MISC_193] assertions and their claims under the federal[MISC_90], the same 1993 statute that[MISC_92]a legislators used in developing their new state law[ORG_105] But last August, the 5th U[ORG_105]S[ORG_105] Circuit Court of Appeals ast August, the[ORG_212] reversed the trial court's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government's action would violate the federal[MISC_194]. On March 10, the federal government returned the eagle feathers to[PER_413]. But the legal war isn't over. The federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute[PER_413] and his congregants, so[PER_413] is seeking a preliminary injunction, claiming the feds are violating the federal[MISC_194], said[PER_415],[PER_413]'s attorney who's with the[ORG_213]. A tea used by a[MISC_195] faith is to them like wine used by[MISC_127] at communion, but[LOC_94]. agents considered the brew an illegal drug. The religious organization[ORG_214] uses a sacramental tea called hoasca, made from two plants native to the[LOC_233] that contains dimethyltryptamine, a hallucinogen, in violation of the[MISC_196]. The religion is a[MISC_57] spiritist faith that originated in Bs a[MISC_57] spiritist faith that originated in[LOC_234] and includes[MISC_197] and indigenous spiritual traditions[ORG_105] About 140 members of the church live in the[LOC_2] and use the tea in a sacred communion[ORG_105] In May 1999, U[ORG_105]S[ORG_105] Customs agents entered the church headquarters in[LOC_235],[LOC_236], and seized all of its hoasca[ORG_105] The church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for[MISC_198] to use another illegal drug, peyote, in their religious ceremonies[ORG_105] In fact, the federal[MISC_194] was designed partly to protect the[MISC_192]' use of peyote, said[ORG_10] legal analyst[PER_416][ORG_105] "They were a legitimate religion, and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion, and[ORG_60] wanted to make sure it was protected,"[PER_417] said of peyote and the 1993 law[ORG_105] The[ORG_216], which means "[ORG_217]," cited that federal law in suing the federal government[ORG_105] "The government has never explained why it has accommodated[ORG_218]'s use has accommodated[ORG_218]'s use of peyote (which contains mescaline, also a controlled substance) but cannot accommodate the[ORG_219]'s use of hoasca," the church said in a statement[ORG_105] The[ORG_109][ORG_105]S[ORG_105] Supreme Court ruled in the church's favor, saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use[ORG_105] "The peyote exception also fatally undermines the government's broader contention that the[MISC_196] establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under[MISC_194]," the court ruling said[ORG_105][PER_418], an[MISC_199] prisoner in[LOC_15], wanted kosher meals, but the warden said no[ORG_105] So[PER_419] sued the state prison system in 2010, saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the Religious Land[ORG_109]se and Institutionalized Persons Act of[MISC_201], a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law[ORG_105][PER_419], 66, is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents, in their 70s, in 1995 allegedrdering his parents, in their 70s, in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home. The prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns, namely "retaliation against the kosher inmates" if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food, court papers said. At least 35 other states and the federal government, however, provided kosher diets to inmates. After losing before a magistrate,[PER_419] won an appeal before the[ORG_221], which cited "the defendant's meager efforts to explain why[LOC_15]'s prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in[LOC_15]." Recently baptized in the[MISC_184] faith,[PER_420] went to her job with the[ORG_207] in[LOC_237] in 2005 carrying a new religious item: a 9-inch kirpan, a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved.[PER_421] needed to carry the kirpan at all times as[PER_421] needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith. But the federal government banned her from the building, citing the kirpan as a "dangerous weapon" with a more than 3-inch blade, and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace.[PER_421] sued the government under the federal law.[PER_421] cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects: real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes, said her attorneys with the[ORG_222] and the[ORG_223]. Also, federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives. In November, the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of[PER_421]'s trial. The settlement included no admission of wrongdoing, the[ORG_224] reported.[PER_421]'s attorneys described the settlement as "a groundbreaking policy allowing[MISC_202] and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols er religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings," they said in a statement[MISC_185] Invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes doesn't always equate to victory[MISC_185] In[LOC_92], an association of 40 churches called the[ORG_225] found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones[MISC_185] The ministers needed a special use permit, but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one, the church leaders claimed[MISC_185] In fact, it was easier to get a club, lodge or community center approved[MISC_185] So the pastors sued the city of[LOC_92] in 2000, alleging that its zoning laws violated the[LOC_114] religious freedom statute, the federal[MISC_200] and the[MISC_186][MISC_185]S[MISC_185] Constitution[MISC_185] But in 2003, the[ORG_226] upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group's claims, finding no substantial burden on the churches, which also failed to esta burden on the churches, which also failed to establish their[MISC_204] claim[ORG_105] Defeated, church leaders were angry[ORG_105] "The forty (40) churches in C[ORG_105]L[ORG_105]U[ORG_105]B[ORG_105] and certainly people of all faiths throughout[LOC_92] are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the[MISC_200] passed unanimously by[ORG_60] in 2000," Apostle[PER_422], the group's chairman, said in a statement[ORG_105] "Also alarming is the court's conclusion that[LOC_92]'s religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws[ORG_105] The majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing," he said[ORG_105] At the same time, the city of[LOC_92] revised its zoning ordinance to avoid "the threat of heightened scrutiny under[MISC_204]," according to a[ORG_228] report in 2002[ORG_105] CNN's[PER_423] contributed to this report[ORG_105]

HEADLINE:[PER_468]: President[PER_195] is right to want a deal, but this one gives[LOC_20] too much [LOC_16]
[MISC_219]he says the framework agreement starts lifting[LOC_20] sanctions much too soon [LOC_16]
========================================
([ORG_3])President[PER_195] tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with[LOC_20] even before he became the[MISC_88] candidate for president[LOC_16] Reaching a good, solid agreedidate for president. Reaching a good, solid agreement with[LOC_20] is a worthy, desirable goal. But the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations, weakening[LOC_84]'s hand and strengthening[LOC_20].[PER_192]'s political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with[LOC_20] that if the deal ultimately collapses, he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it. There is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the[LOC_2] and not[LOC_20] that is the more eager, even desperate, side in these talks, even though[LOC_20] is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions; the country whose only significant export, oil, lost more than half of its value in recent months. The reason is that[PER_192] has a huge political stake in these negotiations. The President may insist that the[LOC_2] will choose no deal over a bad deal, but few people truly belieo deal over a bad deal, but few people truly believe he has a credible Plan B. Few believe it, particularly in the[LOC_52] and notably among[LOC_84]'s[MISC_221] friends, who hold the view that[LOC_20] is running circles around the[LOC_2] and outplayed[PER_192]. As the writer[PER_469] aptly put it, "[LOC_21] is having a great[PER_192] administration." That's a belief that has already started shaking up the region. Saudi[MISC_221]ia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes[LOC_20] has not been stopped, and there is little doubt that other countries among[LOC_20]'s[MISC_74] rivals will do the same. In fact, the notion that[PER_192] is not handling the[LOC_20]ian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in[LOC_212], where Saudi[MISC_221]ia and other[MISC_221]s are trying to push back against gains by[LOC_20]'s allies. We can trace it all back to the[MISC_88] primaries in 2007, when then-Sen.[PER_192] said he would meet[LOC_20]'s leaders "without preconditions," leading his rival,[PER_147], to call the idea "Irresponsibll,[PER_147], to call the idea "Irresponsible and frankly naive[MISC_185]" As the years of his presidency unfolded, and the[LOC_52] started coming apart, finding a deal with[LOC_20] started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement[PER_192] might leave behind[MISC_185] The political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace[MISC_185] The framework agreement announced on Thursday came two days after[PER_192]'s March 31 deadline[MISC_185] The[MISC_186][MISC_185]S[MISC_185]-imposed deadline served only to pressure the[MISC_186]nited States, and the[MISC_51] ambassador very publicly decried as a "bad tactic[MISC_185]" That bad tactic was a political move, a push to produce some sort of result, however vague, to protect the talks from critics[MISC_185] Again, a solid agreement that ensures[LOC_20] will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development[MISC_185] But the agreement so far does not look promising[MISC_185] It certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what[PER_192] had vowed[MISC_185] In a presidential atly from what[PER_192] had vowed[ORG_105] In a presidential debate in 2012,[PER_192] described a crystal clear goal for negotiations[ORG_105] "The deal we'll accept is they end their nuclear program[ORG_105] It's very straightforward[ORG_105]" Nobody is talking about[LOC_20] ending its nuclear program[ORG_105] Not even close[ORG_105][LOC_20] will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges[ORG_105] That's not a small symbolic number[ORG_105] And it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled, although[LOC_262] will contain no nuclear materials[ORG_105][LOC_20] has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses[ORG_105] The fact is that[LOC_20] has a well-established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to U[ORG_105]N[ORG_105] inspectors[ORG_105] And the U[ORG_105]N[ORG_105] agency chief says that has not stopped[ORG_105] A couple of weeks ago, with days left until the negotiating deadline, U[ORG_105]N[ORG_105] nuclear chief[PER_470] said[LOC_20] is still stonewalling[ORG_105] "We are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in[LOC_20] is [for a] peaceful purp nuclear material in[LOC_20] is [for a] peaceful purpose," he warned[MISC_185] The negotiations' starting point is that[LOC_20] would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably, forever[MISC_185] The world only learned about[LOC_20]'s secret facilities at[LOC_263] and[LOC_264] after dissidents raised the alarm[MISC_185][LOC_20], we have learned repeatedly, is very good at lying to international inspectors[MISC_185] It is well-established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program[MISC_185] It is well-established that many of[LOC_20]'s neighbors don't trust it and are anxious about the[MISC_186][MISC_185]S[MISC_185]-led international dealings with[LOC_20][MISC_185] It is well-established that[LOC_20] has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region[MISC_185] It is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring[LOC_20] to the negotiating table[MISC_185] It was[LOC_20] that had the most to lose from a failure of talks[MISC_185] But political considerations turned the[MISC_186]nited States into the supplicanations turned the[LOC_2] into the supplicant. The framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon. Nuclear enrichment will continue, although at a lower level.[LOC_20] officially, legally, becomes a nuclear threshold state, with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a "breakout" period of one year, the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act. Even the[LOC_262] facility, conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain, will remain in existence, though "converted" to a nuclear "research facility" And without nuclear material on site. International sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately. Its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place, even if operating at a reduced pace, giving[LOC_20] much of what it wanted. With[LOC_20]ian forces gaining ground in[MISC_221] lands and[LOC_20]ian commanders declaring the destruction of[LOC_6] "nonnegotiable" and threatening Saudi[MISC_221]ia, this deal does not look reasatening[LOC_58], this deal does not look reassuring.[PER_192] is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option. But the deal so far looks like (another) win for[LOC_20]. It introduces enough restrictions that it could give the President the political cover he wants, but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the[LOC_52].

HEADLINE: An outside review found that a[ORG_265] article about campus rape was "deeply flawed"
[PER_489] says that there are obstacles to a successful libel case, should one be filed .
========================================
([ORG_3])According to an outside review by[ORG_266] professors, "(a)n institutional failure at[ORG_265] resulted in a deeply flawed article about a purported gang rape at the[ORG_267]." The[ORG_268] team concluded that "The failure encompassed reporting, editing, editorial supervision and fact-checking." Hardly a ringing endorsement of the editorial process at the publication. The magazine's managing editor,[PER_490], wrote, "We would like to apologize to our readers and to "We would like to apologize to our readers and to all of those who were damaged by our story and the ensuing fallout, including members of the[ORG_269] fraternity and[ORG_270] administrators and students."[PER_491]: Fraternity to 'pursue all available legal action' The next question is: . Can[ORG_270],[ORG_269] or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? The[ORG_271] said in Jordan v.[PER_492] that "the elements of libel are (1) publication of (2) an actionable statement with (3) the requisite intent." "Actionable" means the statement must be both false and defamatory. Of course, the law of defamation must be balanced against the freedom of speech protected under not only the[MISC_193] to the United States Constitution, but also the[MISC_231]. True statements cannot be defamatory. Neither can pure statements of opinion, because they theoretically cannot be either true or false. But the[ORG_265] article certainly purported to be fact, and it apparentle certainly purported to be fact, and it apparently is not exactly what the law considers "true." The individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals, and not public figures; the latter have a harder time proving defamation. A private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person's reputation. The private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false, or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis, or acted negligently in checking the facts. At first blush, that sounds like it fits perfectly, right? The[ORG_268] report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent. But that's only half the battle. There are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this. The identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters. First, let's eliminate[ORG_270]. The university is a public univers eliminate[ORG_270]. The university is a public university, and therefore it is a governmental entity. The[ORG_61] has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. There is no such cause of action in[MISC_21] jurisprudence. Now the fraternities, starting with[ORG_269]. A fraternity is not an individual, but a group. A plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were "of or concerning" the plaintiff. It sounds obvious, but if you're going to say a statement hurt you, you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with. When the statements are about a group without naming an individual, it's hard to say the statement is "concerning" the individual -- and groups generally cannot sue.  For example, you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief, but that same person cannot sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's inoup are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part. Like all rules, however, there are exceptions. If the defamatory language is about "a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group, an individual member may sue." If I said, "The 1980[ORG_272] infielders were a bunch of criminals" (they weren't),  the individual players could sue, because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if I said that -- which I didn't.[ORG_269] would likely argue that the "small group" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. On the other hand,[ORG_265]'s lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid (after all, the membership changes somewhat every year), that even though the fraternity's reputation ar), that even though the fraternity's reputation is tarnished, the members have suffered no individualized injury. As for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story, that's likely a group that moves from the small category to large, and the members of[MISC_232] life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit. Lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on Facebook, but that such cases are rarely actually filed. That's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm. So if your[PER_493] calls you a loser on Twitter, you're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially. And since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits  on Facebook live in their moms' basements and are "between jobs," these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place. The[ORG_270] situation is not youe in the first place. The[ORG_270] situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case. The university won't be able to sue, but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim, and they can make a tangible case for damages, then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases.

========================================
([ORG_3])One of[LOC_188]'s most prominent districts has taken a small, byo's most prominent districts has taken a small, but potentially significant step to recognizing same-sex unions in[LOC_265]. The government of[LOC_266] ward, one of the capital's most famous shopping and trendy entertainment districts, passed ordinance on Wednesday paving the way for "partnership certificates" for same-sex couples, allowing them some of the rights of married heterosexual couples. Same-sex partners who are registered with the district's ward office will be able to hold visitation rights in hospitals and co-sign tenancy agreements. Other advantages that heterosexual married couples enjoy, such as joint filing of taxes, are controlled by the federal government and are outside the remit of individual municipalities. The measure was proposed in February by[LOC_266]'s mayor,[PER_494]. While the certificates will not be issued until later in the summer and are not legally binding, proponents of marriage equality in socially conservative[LOC_265] say that the ward's decision is a step in the rightay that the ward's decision is a step in the right direction. "It is not a marriage license and advantages will be limited but still better than nothing,"[PER_495], a gay rights activist, told[ORG_10]. While[LOC_266]'s decision does not yet equate to heterosexual marriage, the hope is that the move will be the beginnings of promoting marriage equality for gay communities. "What is important for the[MISC_35] (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) community in[LOC_266] is the ruling will make us visible in society," [PER_496] said . "It could be a strong driver for[LOC_266] citizens to learn and know what kind of problems[MISC_35] people are facing."[PER_497],[LOC_188] councillor and the first male gay local assembly member in[LOC_265], told[ORG_10] the ordinance was a "big first step for the protection of human rights." He called the decision "happy" but said that it must go alongside education about alternative lifestyles. He said that the most important part of today's announcement is that it "should be actually put inannouncement is that it "should be actually put into practice, as should education for understanding ([MISC_36] individuals) especially they suffer as they find out their sexuality when they are young." Neighboring[LOC_267] ward has indicated that it would look into following[LOC_266]'s lead. However, former councilor[PER_498] cautioned against taking the movement's momentum for granted. "To realize equal rights for gay couples, a national law has to be made," he said. While outright discrimination against the [MISC_36] community is rare in[LOC_265], its effects can be hidden and gay people often find themselves at a disadvantage. Many hide their sexuality from their employers, co-workers, families and friends. But the tide may be turning. A recent poll found that a slight majority at 52.4% oppose gay marriage, but support amongst young adults in their 20s and 30s is as high as 70%. An editorial in the[ORG_273] newspaper, which commissioned the poll, welcomed the[LOC_266] decision, calling it "a bold and important stepya decision, calling it "a bold and important step forward." Only traditional marriages are recognized under[LOC_265]'s constitution, but the wording is vague enough to open it to interpretation, according to[PER_499], a professor of gender and politics at[ORG_274] in[LOC_188]. "The constitution does not rule out same-sex marriage, so an interpretation can be made that it is constitutional,"[PER_500] told[ORG_275]. While Prime Minister[PER_501] and the ruling[ORG_276] "don't like the idea of same-sex marriage, but at the same time the issue is gaining momentum." Conservative groups were vocal in their opposition, with one, known as the[ORG_277], telling the[LOC_265] Times that granting same-sex couples the same rights as all other[LOC_265]ese citizens would degrade the "familial system and practice that heterosexual unions have long preserved in human history." While[LOC_266]'s registration system will be a first for[LOC_265],[LOC_268] ward in the westll be a first for[LOC_265],[LOC_268] ward in the western[LOC_265]ese city of[LOC_269] was the first in the nation to recognize and support the[MISC_35] community.

Public health officials warned consumers Friday not to eat any[ORG_279]-branded products made at the company's[LOC_270],[LOC_140], plant. That includes 3-ounce servings of[ORG_279] ice cream from this plant that went to institutions in containers marked with the letters O, P, Q, R, S or T behind the coding date. The warning by the[ORG_28] does not affect other[ORG_279] ice cream, including other 3-ounce servings, not made at the plant. But[ORG_279] has recalled other products. The company is shutting down the[LOC_270] facility "out of an abundance of caution" to search for a possible cause of contamination. It is the third time[ORG_279] has taken action in light of a listeria outbreak at a[LOC_261] hospital that served the company's ice cream. Listeria monocytogenes was recently found in a cup of ice cream recovered from the hospital. The cup contaminream recovered from the hospital. The cup contaminated with the bacteria was produced at the[LOC_270] plant in April 2014,[ORG_279] said. And, according to the[ORG_281], listeria bacteria was found in additional samples of the same product that were recovered from the plant. The bacteria in the hospital sample and the factory sample appeared to match each other genetically, the[ORG_281] said. But they did not appear identical to listeria samples taken from patients infected in the[LOC_261] outbreak. In a separate outbreak in[LOC_88], the[ORG_281] did find that listeria samples taken from patients who came down with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 in a hospital that served 3-ounce[ORG_279] cups matched the listeria in recovered samples. None of this means the ice cream is the source of either spate of the infections. "Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to[ORG_279] products is ongoing," the[ORG_281] said. In early March, in light of the[LOC_261] listeria outbreak,[ORG_279] recalled a groKansas listeria outbreak,[ORG_279] recalled a group of products made at a plant in[LOC_88]. It later added 3-ounce cup servings to the recall. Five people were infected and three died in the past year in[LOC_261] from listeria that might be linked to[ORG_279] Creameries products, according to the[ORG_281]. All five of them were hospitalized at the same hospital before developing listeriosis, the[ORG_281] said. At least four of them had consumed milkshakes made with[ORG_279] ice cream before developing the infection. "We are devastated and know that[ORG_279] has to be and can be better than this,"[PER_503],[ORG_279] CEO and president, said in a statement. "Quality and safety have always been our top priorities. We are deeply saddened and concerned for all those who have been affected." The[ORG_281] advises that individuals and institutions should check their freezers for the recalled products and throw them away. In a statement on its website,[ORG_279] said "this recall in no way includes[ORG_279] ice cream half gallonsn no way includes[ORG_279] ice cream half gallons, pints, quarts, 3 gallons or other 3 oz. cups." This has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of[ORG_279] Creameries, the company said. Listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria, and primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weakened immune systems, according to the[ORG_281]. Symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches, sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. In the[LOC_2], an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year, and approximately 16% of these illnesses result in death. Cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters.[ORG_10]'s[PER_504],[PER_505] and[PER_506] contributed to this report.

And fighting has killed hundreds of people in less than two weeks. The[MISC_241] coalition smashed parts of[LOC_212]'s[ORG_292] in the capital over the weekend, senior[MISC_240] officials said.

Many fear they will lose access to clean water as well.[LOC_212]'s deposed President[PER_513] heaped scorn on top of the airstrikes. He fired his former[ORG_255] chief of staff,[PER_514], on Sunday.

On Monday, more than 50 people died in the port city of[LOC_273] alone, where[MISC_247]s and their allies are battling troops loyal to[PER_516] on the ground,[ORG_293] reported. Since the bombing campaign and intense fighting began just over a week ago, some 600 people are estimated to have been killed. Many more have been wounded, and tens of thousands have fled the country. The[ORG_294] has cried out for a humanitarian ceasefire to let aid in. "Otherwise, put starkly, many more people will die.

But[PER_516] escaped in February, fled to[LOC_273] and declared himself to still be president.[MISC_247]s and their allies, including those loyal to[PER_516]'s predecessor, then fought[PER_516]'s forces in the[LOC_273] area.[PER_516] fled[LOC_273] in late March, ultimately for[LOC_58], when the rebels and their military allies advanced on the city.

([ORG_3])The[ORG_122] has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists, the[MISC_252] bomb maker known as[PER_536], was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the[LOC_64] in January.[PER_536], whose real name is[PER_537], was believed by the[ORG_122] to a member of[MISC_253] terror group[ORG_306]'s central command. The[ORG_122] said in February that a DNA sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern[LOC_64] showed a link with a known relative of[PER_536]. But the[ORG_122] now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted[MISC_13] extremist.

The[ORG_122] had been offering a $5 million reward for information leading to[PER_536]'s capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a[LOC_110] court. It accused him of being a supplier of IEDs to terrorist organizations, and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups, including the[MISC_254][ORG_307].[PER_536] had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by[MISC_25] security forces in 2012.

But in January it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of[PER_536] at[LOC_281], in the southern province of[LOC_282]. The mission went disastrously awry. Forty-four members of the police's elite[ORG_310] ([ORG_311]) unit were killed in the assault, targeForce ([ORG_311]) unit were killed in the assault, targeting an area controlled by the[ORG_313] ([ORG_314]) -- a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the[LOC_64] government. According to a report released by the[ORG_315] ([ORG_316]) last month, the [ORG_314] faction sheltering[PER_536] had sworn allegiance to[ORG_123]. In the immediate aftermath of the assault, the [ORG_311] company charged with executing[PER_536] came under fire, before another [ORG_311] company stationed in nearby[ORG_319] territory as a "blocking force" became engaged in an eight-hour firefight with[ORG_319] fighters.

While an[ORG_318] superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it, controversy has dogged the botched mission in the[LOC_64].

([ORG_3])Comedian[PER_550] made light of racial disparities in police treatment of whites and blackisparities in police treatment of whites and blacks with a tongue-in-cheek guide to not being beaten by the police. He encapsulated the frustration and grief caused by a[LOC_147] grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the death of a black man with a simple tweet: "This one was on film." Now, he's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks. "Stopped by the cops again wish me luck," he posted early Tuesday, along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background. He posted similar photos in February. Many[MISC_255] have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason, calling it "driving while black." Blacks are about 30% more likely to be pulled over by police than whites, according to figures reported by the[ORG_334] in 2013.

He got lots of support on Twitter. "My heart legit dropped, no kidding," one Twitter fan posted. Many praised him for documenting the stops. Some accused him of race-baiting. But one bit of advice in particular lit up social media. Actor[PER_554] urged[PER_553] to "#Adapt" to avoid racial profiling. "I sold my $90,000.00[MISC_256] and bought 3[MISC_257], because I got tired of being pulled over by Police,"[PER_555] tweeted. Some saw that as a sell-out, saying[PER_553] shouldn't have to take steps others might not have to as a way to avoid being pulled over.

========================================
[LOC_292] ([ORG_3])Six people were hurt after an explosion at a controversial chemical plant in[LOC_45]'s southeastern[LOC_291] province sparked a huge fire, provincial authorities told state media. The plant, located in[LOC_293] city, produces paraxylene (PX), a reportedly carcinogenic chemical used in the production of polyester films and fabrics. The blast occurred at an oil storage facility Monday night after an oil leak, though local media has not reported any toxic chemical spill. Five out of six people were injured by broken glass and have been sent to the hospital for treatment,[ORG_337] news agency reported. More than 600 firefighters were sent to battle the blaze and the fire is now under control, the[LOC_293] fire department wrote on their official microblogging account Tuesdaote on their official microblogging account Tuesday morning. Residents living close to the plant had heard the explosion and took to Weibo to post photos of the fire. One user wrote that he heard a loud blast and felt slight tremors. The plant was hit by another explosion in July 2013, although there were no reports of casualties or toxic leaks at the time. Though demonstrations are illegal in[LOC_45], the construction of[ORG_339] plants has sparked protests, which have occasionally turned violent, in several cities in recent years. The[LOC_293] plant was slated for[LOC_294] -- a densely populated city in the southeast of the country. However, it provoked an angry backlash in 2007 due to pollution concerns and prompted the local government to relocate the factory to its current, more remote location.

HEADLINE:[ORG_23] prosecuting[ORG_340] over unauthorized shipment of drugs .
[PER_489]:[ORG_340] has a strong argument that it shouldn't be held responsible .
========================================
([ORG_3])The[ORG_341] has named a new defendant in the war on drugs, and the charges are serious indeed. A 15-count indictment filed in federal court in[LOC_110] bristles with accusations of conspiracies, transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions, violations of the[MISC_196], misbranding charges, and money laundering charges. Who is this menace to society?[ORG_340]. Yes, the courier delivery service. Wait, can companies even be charged with crimes?  Where would a[ORG_340] be incarcerated?  Is there a corporate[LOC_295]?  How does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit? It turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person[LOC_16] It's a practice the[ORG_61] has approved of for over a century[LOC_16] In fact, in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people[LOC_16]  Corporations don't have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes[LOC_16] Imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive, but corporate convictions, on the other hand, turn tidy profits for the U[LOC_16]S[LOC_16] government, with zero prison overhead[LOC_16] Even if corporations can be held criminally liable, should a courier service like[ORG_340] be held liable for "possessing" what bad guys may send through the service? The answer, according to[ORG_340], is not just "No," but a "No" so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom[LOC_16] The company maintains that it is innocent[LOC_16] It has a point[LOC_16] "Possession" is an elusive concept[LOC_16]  When it comes to drugs, the law recognizes two kinds of possession: actual and constructive[LOC_16] Actual possession is when you have physical control over the contraband[LOC_16] When you have a gun  control over the contraband. When you have a gun in your hand or drugs in your pocket, you "actually" possess those things. The somewhat hazier concept of "constructive possession" means you can "possess" something without even having it on your person, as long as you have ownership, dominion or control over the contraband or the property where it is found. For example, the government would argue that while you may not have actual possession of the 5,000[MISC_258] pills in the trunk of your car parked in your driveway, you "constructively" possessed them. Conversely, sometimes you can be holding something in your hand or have it in your vehicle, but not "possess" it either actually or constructively, in the eyes of the law. Such is the case with couriers who routinely drive to your home, walk up to your door and hand you a package, completely ignorant about what is inside it. It's hard to argue the[ORG_342] guy intentionally "possessed" your subscription to porno mags, in their nondescript brown packaging. That imags, in their nondescript brown packaging. That is the idea behind the "common carrier" exception to possession, and a large part of[ORG_340]'s compelling legal argument. A "common carrier" is one who offers its services to members of the public -- without much discretion -- and is engaged in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation. The public policy reasons behind "common carrier" exemptions make sense; the industry simply couldn't function if every driver, courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of[MISC_258] had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door. That would lead to an absurd result. That's why the[MISC_196] and the[MISC_259] allow common carriers to lawfully possess controlled substances, so long as it is in the usual course of their business. Of course, this is not a permission slip for drug runners to avoid liability by calling themselves "common carriers." That's why the "usual coselves "common carriers." That's why the "usual course of business" language acts as an additional safety measure. In court papers,[ORG_340]'s lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from[LOC_296] to[LOC_297]. This would not be acting in the usual course of business of a common carrier, since this imaginary airline is not offering its services to the public, generally. On the other hand,[ORG_340] argues that it is indeed a common carrier, performing the normal duties of a common carrier, because (a) it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and (b) it offers its services to the public generally. It's hard to imagine extending liability to common carriers for possession of contraband. Does this mean a[ORG_343] bus driver becomes liable for marijuana possessed by a passenger? The bus driver would argue he has no reason to know if a particular passenger is carrying drugs. But if the guy boards the bus with a[ORG_344] T-shirt and a set of bongos, with a[ORG_344] T-shirt and a set of bongos, shouldn't the driver at least have a hunch? That seems dangerously close to profiling. Is this another illogical straw man argument? Maybe. Obviously, the[ORG_345] disagrees, which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution. According to the indictment, from at least as early as 2004, the[ORG_346], the[ORG_347], and members of[ORG_60] put[ORG_340] on notice that illegal[ORG_348] pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the[MISC_196], the[MISC_259], and numerous state laws. The indictment alleges that as early as 2004,[ORG_340] knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts.[ORG_340]'s couriers in[LOC_41],[LOC_298], and[LOC_121] expressed safety concerns that were circulated to[ORG_340] senior management. The[ORG_349] is making the argument that even though[ORG_340] carries and delivers whatever i even though[ORG_340] carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public,[ORG_340] knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity. It raises a larger question, though: Why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we can't even incarcerate? The answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs, and drug smugglers smuggle them: Money. Power. The government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations -- in this case, it would be to force[ORG_340] to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation. The government also gets to extract gargantuan sums of money from corporations in "deferred prosecution agreements." The reason you don't see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements; for a company, a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence, whether or not it's found guilty. Still, every defense attorney would love to offer the optioery defense attorney would love to offer the option to his or her human clients of avoiding felony conviction and a potential life sentence -- by agreeing to pay some fines. Don't get me wrong: I'm all about prosecuting the black market, especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with "V1AGRA" in the subject line, for our co-workers to see while we go to the bathroom. I want those guys locked up for sure. I'm just not sure that[ORG_340] has anything to do with the kingpins of the "[MISC_260]" email campaign. The[ORG_349]'s underlying intentions are noble enough -- this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain. It makes good strategic sense. It might seem like good financial sense in the short run, with the millions in fines extracted from corporations, but that money has to come from somewhere. It's just a matter of time before that trickles down to job cuts and less leg room on our flights. It probably doesnnd less leg room on our flights. It probably doesn't make good legal sense either. Yes, we have been treating corporations as fictional "persons" for centuries in some ways -- but it's silly to treat them as persons in all ways.[ORG_340] has a strong argument for dismissal in this case, but even if not, it won't be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon.

HEADLINE: "[MISC_267]'s" final seven episodes begin airing April 5 .
The show has never had high ratings but is considered one of the great TV series .
It's unknown what will happen to characters, but we can always guess .
========================================
([ORG_3])This is the end. Beautiful friend, the end. For the 1960s, the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the[ORG_361]'[LOC_301] fiasco in December 1969, the Kent State shootings in May 1970 or[PER_579]'s 1972 re-election. For "[MISC_267]," the "end of an era," as its slogan has it, begins Sunday. Over the past eight years, the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its che show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric, if never a huge ratings hit. Stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show; there have been "[MISC_267]" cocktails and "[MISC_267]" museum exhibits and even "[MISC_267]" presidential references.[PER_580], the creative director played by[PER_581], has become a symbol of the times -- his and, sometimes, ours. Its subjects have taken the show to heart. In March, a "[MISC_267]" bench was unveiled in front of[LOC_147]'s Time & Life Building, where the fictional firm of[ORG_362] has its headquarters. The end of a TV series brings with it some risk. "[MISC_268]," "[MISC_267]" creator[PER_582]'s former employer, divided fans with its famous cut-to-black finale. On the other hand, "[MISC_267]'s" former[ORG_363] stablemate, "[MISC_269]," was saluted for an almost perfect landing. Speaking of landings: The last season -- technically, the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landfirst half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in July 1969. Though[PER_583] and his cast have been typically tight-lipped --[PER_583] even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward. What's going to happen? Here are some educated guesses. With the '60s screaming towards their conclusion, "[MISC_267]" probably won't jump ahead much. The latter half of 1969 included the[PER_584] murders, the[MISC_270] festival, a[LOC_147] mayoral campaign and the[MISC_271] moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with, if only tangentially. Who knows? The show might even mention the[ORG_364]. It would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency's late[PER_585]. Of course,[PER_583] might have a different idea; he's from[LOC_302]. "[MISC_267]" is generally a show about disintegration, reflective of the '60s themselves. The old orders are falling apart: white-shoe[MISC_272] firms like[ORG_365] giving way to the ethnic pace-setteterling Cooper giving way to the ethnic pace-setters such as Doyle Dane Bernbach; grimy[LOC_147] replaced by sunny[LOC_76]; the[MISC_273]" generation butting heads with the "Make Love, Not War" cohort; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek, solid-state[ORG_367] world. It's all an ad agency can do to keep up. Last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil, thanks to the ill-fitting merger between[ORG_365] and former rival[ORG_368]. Though the agency survived, it's now without[PER_586] ([PER_587]) and under the ownership of (real-life)[LOC_303] titan[ORG_369]. That's not a recipe for long-term survival, and expect a number of longtime characters --[PER_588] ([PER_589]),[PER_590] ([PER_591]) and perhaps even[PER_592] ([PER_593]) -- to look for an exit.[PER_594] -- the wisecracking executive played by[PER_595] -- might find an exit as well, but not one he's anticipating. He's suffered two heart attacks. He drinks to eg. He's suffered two heart attacks. He drinks to excess. He's never grown up. Bet on a sudden and shocking departure. On the other hand,[PER_596]'s star has continued to rise (much like one of the character's models, advertising wunderkind[PER_597]). She left[ORG_365] once; indeed, she wouldn't have returned if her new agency hadn't merged with her old one. If[PER_598], played by[PER_599], bolts the firm, it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married. That is, if she's still interested in such an old-fashioned tradition. In recent seasons,[PER_600]'s ex-wife,[PER_601] ([PER_602]), has lost herself amid all the turmoil. She sees herself through the eyes of her spouses, and though husband[PER_603] ([PER_604]) has been far more supportive than[PER_600], he's a busy man. And[PER_605],[PER_600]'s daughter ([PER_606]), is proving to be a handful. On the one hand, she's obviously bright; on the other, she's a teenager and starting to rebel. In recent seasons she's er and starting to rebel. In recent seasons she's run away and started sneaking cigarettes, and she's always fighting with her mother. You could see her hitchhiking to[LOC_304], or at least dropping out of school. Anything's possible, but given all that the character has been through -- divorces, affairs, office politics, morose late-night rides with[PER_607] -- it's a bit on the nose, isn't it? Instead, try this: It's April 1, 1970.[PER_579] is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television, reminding[PER_600] of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the[ORG_370] campaign that began the series. No fool, he had seen this day coming years before. He'll fix himself a drink, ponder buying an avocado-colored refrigerator, clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived: on top of the zeitgeist, unable to accept his past and utterly, inscrutably alone.

([ORG_3])[PER_629], one of[LOC_73]'s best-loved singers and songwriters, died of cancer Friday at the age of 66. He had performed most recently in[LOC_70] on[MISC_280]. The performer, who was also an accomplished guitarist, was first diagnosed with cancer in 1990, the year he competed in the[MISC_281], and the year before he released the album that ignited his career. The cancer returned in 2005 and then again in 2014,[LOC_73]'s semiofficial[ORG_381] reported. He died Friday in a hospital in[LOC_70], five days after his 66th birthday.

In 1990, he competed in the[MISC_281], finishing 17th. The following year he released an album titled "I Made a Vow," which catapulted him to prominence. Though he recorded nearly 20 albums, that one would remain his most popular. His final album was released in 2007. Other artists recorded his material throughout his career. Videos available online show a vibrant performer with a thick shock of dark hair as he accompanies himself on guitar and croons in a clear tenor.[PER_628] was best known for his love songs.

HEADLINE: Some of[PER_344]' most important financial backers were women, historians say.
[PER_641] of[LOC_317] and[PER_642], both men of stature and wealth, chipped in to help fund[PER_344]' ministry.
========================================
([ORG_3])"Sell all that you own and distribute the money N)"Sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me,"[PER_344] tells the rich man in one of his best-known parables. It was a mantra he invoked repeatedly: the poor were blessed, and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the well-to-do to enter paradise.  Meanwhile,[PER_344] told his Twelve Apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support. So how did this wandering band of  first-century evangelists support themselves? Clearly, money was a concern, and not just as an impediment to salvation. In the[MISC_284], money gets 37 mentions, while "gold" gets 38 citations, "silver" merits 20, and "copper" four. "Coin" comes up eight times, and "purse" and "denarii" -- the[MISC_285] currency -- get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals. Perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged pasvant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the[MISC_284]: . As the[MISC_286] tells it, six days before[MISC_135],[PER_344] was in[LOC_318] at the house of his friend[PER_643], whom he had raised from the dead. A woman named[PER_644] takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining[PER_344]. She dries his feet with her hair, an irresistible image for artists and dramatists.[PER_645] objected to the act. "Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?"[PER_646] asks. Though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer,[PER_344] told[PER_646] to leave her alone, and foreshadowing his fate, said the anointing would be useful for his burial, and besides, "you always have the poor with you" -- but[PER_344] would not always be there. What that passage makes clear is that the[PER_344] community had a common purse because they needed money to survive. So how much? "I imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level," Rabbi[PER_647], a pr a subsistence level," Rabbi[PER_647], a professor of[MISC_287] and[MISC_288] at[ORG_390] in[LOC_76].[PER_344] and his disciples walked, wore what they had, slept outside or in stayed in friends' homes. They ate what they caught or what others shared. "I venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of[PER_344] and the companions with whom he traveled,"[PER_648] said.[PER_648] said that it was possible, even likely, that[PER_344] and his followers received donations from supporters, and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite -- or perhaps because of -- his preaching on the perils of wealth. The[MISC_289] gives us a glimpse of how[PER_344]' ministry functioned on a practical level: . "Soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of[PER_313]. The twelve were with him, as well as some women who had been cured of evil sas well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities:[PER_644], called[PER_649], from whom seven demons had gone out,  and[PER_650], the wife of[PER_651]'s steward[PER_652], and[PER_653], and many others, who provided for them  out of their resources." So, according to[PER_654], women whom[PER_344] had healed in turn provided for him out of their "resources," with[PER_644][PER_649] and[PER_650] capturing our attention -- one by virtue of her husband, and the other, by her stature in the story of[PER_344].[PER_650] was an upper-class woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of[PER_651] Antipas, the son of[PER_651] the Great, the violent and ambitious head of[LOC_319]. As part of this volatile but powerful household,[PER_650] would be uniquely positioned to help[PER_344] with her resources, being both wealthy and having palace connections. She attends to him during his life, and, the[MISC_290] tell us, after his death, as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it emhe trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty. With her on that morning is[PER_655], also identified as -- among other things -- a financial supporter of[PER_344].[PER_644] likely came from the prosperous town of[LOC_320], on the[LOC_321]. As home to a thriving fishing industry, as well as dye and textile works,[PER_644] could well have come from an affluent family -- or have been a successful business woman herself.[PER_655] was free to travel the country with[PER_344] and his disciples, so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home, and in "Finding[PER_344]" we examine the[MISC_291] gospel of[PER_655] and explore the argument that[PER_344] was, in fact, her husband. She may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message, and messenger. Not only was[PER_655] one of[PER_344]' most devoted followers, who stuck with him all the way from[LOC_322] to[LOC_216], from the ministry to the cross and the tomb, but also she provided for hie cross and the tomb, but also she provided for him from her own means, said[PER_658], a professor of[MISC_284] and[MISC_292] at[ORG_30]. When the[MISC_290] speak of her "ministering" to[PER_344], they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in[PER_344]' everyday mission,[PER_659] continues. Along with other women like[PER_650] and[PER_653], she was one of those who made his mission viable. Along with these women, men like[PER_660] of[LOC_317] and[PER_642], both men of stature and wealth, may have chipped in to help fund[PER_344]' ministry. The[MISC_290] reveal that both these men were rich, and supported[PER_344] -- indeed, it was[PER_660] who removed[PER_344] from the cross on Good Friday, anointing his body with the help of[PER_642], and placing him in the tomb that[PER_660] had reserved for himself. After the resurrection on that first Easter Sunday, the movement[PER_344] started grew exponentially, and the church's relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater.[PER_661]complicated as the needs became greater.[PER_662] is co-author, with[PER_663], of "Finding[PER_344]: Faith.

([ORG_3])When I was elected==========================
([ORG_3])When I was elected to the[ORG_391] in 1967, I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body.  Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what[PER_287], who today declared he's running for president of the[LOC_2], is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about "expanding the[MISC_38][ORG_73]" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the[ORG_392],[PER_90] has tried to sell himself as a different type of[MISC_38].  He's tried to brand himself as the[MISC_37]'s minority outreach candidate.  The problem for[PER_90], and the[MISC_37] at large, is that they don't back up their words wit large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that[MISC_43] started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen.[PER_90]'s positions makes clear that he does not.[PER_90] kicked off his announcement speech in[LOC_40] by declaring "I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back."  I have no doubt that under[PER_90]'s leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the[MISC_295] --  which[PER_90] has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no[ORG_393] -- a department he thinks "should be done away with;" when women didn't have choices -- choices[PER_90] seeks to limit in[LOC_13]; when[MISC_294]ers weren't protected from deportation -- proDREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections[PER_90] currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But[PER_90] has also questioned the[MISC_295], and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust[MISC_296] following the[ORG_61]'s dismantling of the law,[PER_90] dismissively remarked, "We have an[MISC_297] President." When President[PER_192] stood with[PER_665] and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the[LOC_325] last month to mark the 50th anniversary of[MISC_298], he inspired us all by saying: "With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. ... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote."[LOC_84] is better -- and we solhe right to vote."[LOC_84] is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately[PER_287] has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle. [PER_90] tried once again from that stage in[LOC_40] to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden[MISC_38] appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The[LOC_84]n people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about[PER_287]'s record.  The[LOC_84]n people deserve better than[PER_287].

A representative for[ORG_404] told[ORG_10] that that the loss of pets during air travel is "extremely rare."  The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year.[ORG_404] is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the[LOC_147] airport to help locate the missing cat. The[MISC_300] carrier also said it hired "third-party specialists" to help in the hunt for[PER_668].

On Monday, survivors and victims' families wept and[PER_679] fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21-year-old "brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets."

[LOC_342],[LOC_111] ([ORG_3])As aides politely tried to rush[PER_113] from an event in [LOC_342] to one in[LOC_344],[LOC_111], on Thursday, the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him. Finally, after the selfies and conversations started to die down, his aides managed to move him closer to the door whes aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall, burly man stopped him. "Senator," he said, "can I pray with you real quick?" "Yeah,"[PER_115] said, as he clasped the man's upper arm and the two bowed their heads. It was one of the many moments when[PER_115] connected with voters on a religious level last week, as the senator from[LOC_88] hit the trail in[LOC_111] for the first time as a presidential candidate. Being the only official contender in the race,[PER_115] drew large crowds during his two-day swing across the state. He's counting on[LOC_111], known for its vocal and active evangelical base, to propel him forward in what's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of[MISC_37] candidates.[PER_115], himself, displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room. The senator regularly avoids using a podium, instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone, a scene reminiscent of a Sunday morning sermon. When he meets with people after events, he embraces each one's hand withple after events, he embraces each one's hand with both of his, softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye -- a familiar interaction between churchgoing[MISC_59] and their pastors. The past two winners of[LOC_111]'s caucuses rose to victory with support from the[MISC_57] right, and[PER_115], who announced his bid last month at the well-known[MISC_302] school[ORG_414], is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize. Evangelicals make up a large segment of[LOC_111]'s[MISC_38] voter bloc. According to a[ORG_415] poll from January, 44% of likely 2016[MISC_38] caucus-goers said they were born-again or evangelical[MISC_59].[PER_115] has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck[MISC_37] leadership on fiscal issues, but he showed in[LOC_111] last week that he's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many[MISC_38]s are anxious to avoid them. He was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in[LOC_113]oudest defenders of the religious freedom law in[LOC_83], which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians. He described the outrage over the laws as "shameful" and an "assault" on[MISC_193] rights. "There are a lot of people here in[LOC_111] and across the country whose hearts are breaking, watching what has happened in the last two weeks,"[PER_115] said Friday night at an event in[LOC_345]. "We have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty." RELATED:[MISC_38] 2016 hopefuls back[LOC_83]'s 'religious freedom' law . He's more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a[MISC_57] and a pastor. Rafael[PER_115], who's become a celebrity among[MISC_57] conservatives, will frequently visit[LOC_111] over the next year,[PER_115] told voters. And[PER_115]'s[LOC_111] director,[PER_696], is a former pastor.[PER_115]'s first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on[ORG_416] and[ORG_417] that areekend during programs on[ORG_416] and[ORG_417] that are pegged to Easter Sunday. In the ad,[PER_115] talks about the impact of the "transformative love of[PER_697]" on his life. While neither[PER_116], who won[LOC_111] in 2008, nor[PER_698], who won in 2012, went on to win the nomination, their successes helped launch them into high-profile battles with the then-front-runners. And with both of them likely running again in 2016, the competition will be stiff. That's why, for[PER_115], courting evangelicals is only a component of a three-pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base. His stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction. He received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the[ORG_207], and, in a knock against the[ORG_418], he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so President[PER_192] "can hear every word I have to say."[PER_115] argued Thursday that the[ORG_75] n"[PER_115] argued Thursday that the[ORG_75] needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the[PER_699] faction of the party -- young libertarian-minded voters -- and the[PER_700] base -- evangelicals. The two blocs, he said, are "not necessarily the best of chums." "If we're going to win, we've got to bring that coalition together," he said in[LOC_343]. "And I think we can do that."[PER_115] frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels, when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election, a higher than normal turnout for the demographic. That number has waned slightly since 2004 -- but it's not too far off from the 56% of the overall population that voted in 2012. Still, his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who've been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform, then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls. "If you look at available places for the party to exf you look at available places for the party to expand the vote, it doesn't exist in the middle, it exists in the evangelical vote," said[PER_701], a top[PER_115] adviser[LOC_16] "It isn't a pond, it's an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative[LOC_16]"[PER_702], president of the[ORG_419] of the[ORG_420], said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says[LOC_16][PER_703] points to hot-button topics like religious freedom issues in the U[LOC_16]S[LOC_16], as well as increased attention to the killing of minority[MISC_59] in the[LOC_52] and rising[MISC_303][LOC_16] "I don't think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith,"[PER_703] said[LOC_16] "I think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good[LOC_16]" Later in April, voters in[LOC_346]in the common good." Later in April, voters in[LOC_111] will see the bulk of the[MISC_37] field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the[LOC_111] Faith and Freedom Coalition. While the past two winners of the[LOC_111] caucuses --[PER_700] and[PER_102] -- are likely running for president again,[PER_704], president of the group, argued that the field is wide open in terms of who's going to win favor among evangelicals.[PER_109], while not popular among conservative activists, was known for his staunch anti-abortion record as[LOC_15] governor and touts his[MISC_304] faith as a big force behind his policy views.[PER_118] is the son of a pastor.[PER_119], the former neurosurgeon, rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the[PER_192] administration at a national prayer breakfast.

HEADLINE:[PER_720]: When religious identity, ethics, tolerance are roiling the culture, it's worth looking at message of[MISC_120] and[MISC_117] .
He says ritual enactment of these three days is reminder that again and again the human condition moves through darkness into light .
========================================
([ORG_3])[MISC_118] is unique on the[MISC_57] calendar, a major point in the cycle of the religious year, and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds[MISC_119]. That's in part because[MISC_117] is genuinely about how religious impulses, and patterns, can operate in ways that affect our lives. Nevertheless, I'm often surprised by how little people, even those supposedly within the[MISC_57] tradition, actually know about what is called[MISC_120] and its culmination on[MISC_117] Sunday.   At a time whd its culmination on[MISC_117] Sunday.   At a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics (and tolerance) that have profound religious implications, it's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition, in all its sadness and glory, that it engenders. After all,[MISC_120] calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent.  Still, the fuss must puzzle those looking on, wondering what it all means.  Why do[MISC_59] make so much of this springtime week, and make so much of[MISC_117] weekend? There is a phrase that many never come across, even among[MISC_59]: [MISC_117] Triduum.  This refers to the three days of[MISC_117] that begin with Good Friday, proceed through Holy Saturday, and conclude with[MISC_117] Sunday.  It's definitely a progression, although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer.[MISC_117] Triduum has a kind of major prologue in[MISC_308], the day when, by tradirologue in Maundy Thursday, the day when, by tradition,[PER_344] celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples in the upper room in[LOC_216] on the night before he was crucified.  The idea of Holy Communion begins with this meal, which was a[MISC_135] meal.[PER_344], of course, was[MISC_32], as were all his disciples.  He was never trying to erase[MISC_309] and found a new religion.  His work involved modifying and extending[MISC_309] in fresh ways. On Maundy Thursday,[MISC_59] sometimes practice the washing of feet, recalling that[PER_344] washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the Last Supper as a way of demonstrating profound humility -- showing that he was himself a servant -- and modeling a kind of ideal behavior. Good Friday isn't, in fact, so good.  It's the day of the crucifixion, when[PER_344] was scourged and beaten, forced to carry his cross to[LOC_354], the "place of the skull," and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death.  The actual scene of the[MISC_310] varies from gospe actual scene of the[MISC_311]ifixion varies from gospel to gospel, as do his last words, assembled into the so-called "seven last words" of[PER_344] by adding up fragments from different gospels. Some of these words are quotations, as when[PER_344] asked[PER_313] why he has abandoned him:  This is a quote from the[MISC_312], which opens:  "My[PER_313], my[PER_313], why hast thou forsaken me?" [MISC_134] is a day of death, sacrifice, displacement, fear. Holy Saturday is probably the least understood day of the[MISC_313].  It's a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of[MISC_117].  This day occupies an anxious space in human experience, when the certain knowledge of something dreadful isn't quite erased -- can't be erased -- simply by hope.  It's a day of depression, a day of suspension. Then comes[MISC_117], with the aura of the resurrection.  I'm always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment, when the body of[PER_342] becomes what is called a "glorified body."  This was not, as I've said e a "glorified body."  This was not, as I've said elsewhere, the[MISC_314]uscitation, although that's part of it, too.  Resurrection implies a total transformation, something beyond the physical realm. It's very important that almost nobody who encounters[PER_344] after the resurrection can really recognize him, know him, or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified. [MISC_117] embraces the great mystery of resurrection, with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another, and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding. The three days of[MISC_117], the[MISC_315], occur only once a year on the calendar.  But the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again.  We find ourselves emptied out in small ways, nailed to our own trees in life, embarrassed or broken by life. It was the[PER_721] who famously observed that life is suffering. [MISC_134] embodies the[MISC_57] version of that truth. [PER_344] suffered inhristian version of that truth[PER_31] [PER_344] suffered in the way all of us must suffer[PER_31]  We must all die, perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly[PER_31]  Our friends and families must die[PER_31]  We all experience illness, loss, sadness, a loss of confidence, darkness[PER_31]  This is simply part of the human experience[PER_31] We dive again and again into[MISC_317], too -- a period of transition, when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view[PER_31]  We know well this in-between time; it's an anxious passage, with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope[PER_31] And we've all been resurrected, again and again, perhaps in tiny ways[PER_31]  This is the joy of[MISC_117], and it's not something reserved for one day on the calendar[PER_31]  It's there whenever we experience what T[PER_31]S[PER_31] Eliot once called the "timeless moment," which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself[PER_31]  It's a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time[PER_31] I suspect we all experience the[MISC_315] frequently, sometim we all experience the[MISC_315] frequently, sometimes more than once in a single day.  But the ritual enactment of these three days of the[MISC_117] season reminds all of those who practice[MISC_58] -- and perhaps those who don't -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light. It's a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression.   It's good cause for celebration, too:  and one that won't easily be co-opted by secular culture.

"The drones have been tested in controlled conditions," he said. "They have been very successful and will be used by the[LOC_355] police whenever there are violent protests or mob attacks." The miniature aircraft will be fitted with a camera and pepper spray; each drone costs between $9,560 and $19,300,[PER_724] added. Views on the new measure are mixed, with some concerned about the suppression of freedom of speech -- an already contentious issue in[LOC_173]. Last month, the country failed to enforce a law that would allow authorities to arrest people who post offensive material on social media. Others believe the country could le social media. Others believe the country could learn from events further afield. Some say this method of crowd control needs regulation too. Questions have also been raised as to why the police are resorting to aggression. "While I think it is bound to fail if not be another scam in the making, it also shows the mindset of the administration to not use dialogue and mediation to solve problems but use authoritarian and forceful methods," photojournalist[PER_725] in[LOC_356] told[ORG_10]. "What they could do is start by having video surveillance in sensitive areas and have swifter justice." Protests are a common occurrence in[LOC_173], a country with a population of 1.2 billion;[LOC_355], the capital of the northern state of[LOC_357], also used drone cameras to monitor crowds at a recent religious festival. As well as being used as a security measure in other cities including[LOC_358] and[LOC_356], the unmanned, airborne vehicles have been used in tiger hunts, disaster relief and criminal investigations -- and evaster relief and criminal investigations -- and even pizza deliveries. Reports suggest that the drone surveillance will be officially launched by the Chief Minister of[LOC_355],[PER_726], later this month.[PER_727] contributed to this report.

([ORG_3])Just as the agency begins to recover from a series of high-profile missteps, the[ORG_432] is facing yet another scandal. A female employee accused[PER_728], a supervisor within the agency, of assault after he made sexual advances at  her, according to[ORG_433]. "The woman told police and agency investign[ORG_436]. "The woman told police and agency investigators that[PER_729], her boss, told her during the party at[ORG_435] that he was in love with her and would like to have sex with her," and later tried to kiss her in the office, according to a report from[ORG_433]. During the incident, he "grabbed her arms when she resisted" and the two tussled until[PER_729] gave up, sources told the paper. The[ORG_436] reports that the March 31 party was in celebration of[PER_729]' new assignment as head of the[LOC_40] field office. A[ORG_432] spokesperson confirms that [PER_729] was placed on administrative leave and his security clearance was suspended. This incident was first reported on April 2, and[ORG_432] Director[PER_730] was briefed that afternoon.[PER_731] called the allegations "very disturbing." "Any threats or violence that endangers our employees in  the workplace is unacceptable and will not be tolerated," he said in a statement. This is just the latest chapter for an orgtement. This is just the latest chapter for an organization embroiled in scandal over the past several months. Last month, two top-ranking officials were suspended following an incident at a[LOC_86] command post during an investigation of a possible bomb.[PER_731] was not made aware of the episode until five days later. The agency has also faced scrutiny for another lapse in late January when a drone crash-landed on the[LOC_86] lawn.[ORG_432] Director[PER_732] resigned in September after a fence-jumper gained access to the[LOC_359] of the[LOC_86].

"It's going to take time to change some of this culture,"[PER_731] said at a[ORG_437] hearing last month. "There's no excuse for this information not to come up the chain. That's going to take time because I'm going to have to build trust with our workforce." The incident will be further investigated by the[ORG_438].

HEADLINE: Manuscript of "[MISC_336]" lyrics is sold to unnamed buyer for $1.2 million .
[PER_813]: The song, a talisman for its age, brings joy to people 44 years later .
========================================
([ORG_3])"A long, long, time ago..." Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of[PER_814]'s pop masterpiece "[MISC_336]."  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8½ minute allegory, which millions of[MISC_14] know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as "Bye, Bye, Miss [MISC_336]." There is no real way to categorize[PER_815]'s "[MISC_338] e is no real way to categorize[PER_815]'s "[MISC_336]" for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday,[ORG_461] sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer.[PER_815] was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that[PER_817],[PER_818] and[PER_819] had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in[LOC_382],[LOC_111]. "The next day I went to school in shock and guess what?"[PER_815] recalled.  "Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and[PER_820] hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57."  By cathartically writing "[MISC_336],"[PER_815] has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, "[MISC_339]," in 1969, in[LOC_383],[LOC_110], during the student riots,[PER_815], a native[MISC_340], became a kind of weather vane for what he called the "generation lost in space."   When his cultural anthem "[MISC_341]tion lost in space."   When his cultural anthem "[MISC_336]" was released in November 1971, it replaced[PER_821]'s "[MISC_342]" as the[MISC_343] of the new decade.  It's important to think of "[MISC_336]" as one would of[PER_822]'s "[MISC_344]" or[PER_823]'s "[MISC_345]" -- an essential[MISC_346] poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of "[MISC_336]," for[PER_815]'s lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those[PER_824] tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel "[MISC_347]." Don[PER_815]:[PER_817], rest in peace . Influenced by[PER_825] and the Weavers,[PER_815] proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when "[MISC_336]" topped the[ORG_200] charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing "[MISC_336]" at windblown dance halls in[LOC_384] and cloistered colleges in[LOC_385], at huge amphitheaters in[LOC_110] aNew England, at huge amphitheaters in[LOC_110] and little coffee houses in the[LOC_386],[PER_815] has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When[PER_815] prods audiences by rhapsodizing "and they were singing" everybody spontaneously joins in with the "[MISC_348]" chorus.  Watching[PER_815] deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective[MISC_349]. What makes "[MISC_336]" so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When "[MISC_336]" suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like "[MISC_350]" or "[MISC_351]" or "[MISC_352]," it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down[LOC_387] or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, "[MISC_336]" still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional[MISC_353] folksong, it reminds us of fate. While[PER_815], the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret "[MISC_336]," it's fair to surmise that "the king" is[PER_826], "Helter Skelter" refers to the[PER_827] murders, the "jester on the sidelines in a cast" is[PER_821], and "[PER_828]" the[ORG_361].  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to "[MISC_336]." Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for th of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter[PER_31]  But the fact that the[ORG_462] and the[ORG_463] chose "[MISC_336]" as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art[PER_31]  The other four were "[MISC_354]" (by[PER_829] and E[PER_31]Y "Yip" Harburg), "[MISC_355] "(by[PER_831]), "This Land is Your Land" (by[PER_832]) and "[MISC_356]" (by[PER_833])[PER_31]  That is fine company[PER_31] Quite simply, "[MISC_336]" is one of the greatest songs ever written[PER_31]  And Tuesday the original lyrics found a new home[PER_31]

The song is dense with symbolism;[PER_815] says lyrics, notes will reveal meaning .
"[MISC_357]" is[PER_815]'s biggest hit, was No. 1 in 1972 .
========================================
([ORG_3])That's some rich "[MISC_336]." The lyrics to the famed[PER_814] soerican Pie." The lyrics to the famed[PER_814] song sold for $1.2 million Tuesday morning at an auction held by[ORG_461]. "[PER_843]'s manuscript of '[MISC_336]' achieved the 3rd highest auction price for an[MISC_21] literary manuscript, a fitting tribute to one the foremost singer-songwriters of his generation,"[ORG_461][PER_844] said in a statement.[PER_815] told[ORG_265] that it was time to part with the manuscript. "I'm going to be 70 this year," the singer and songwriter said in February. "I have two children and a wife, and none of them seem to have the mercantile instinct. I want to get the best deal that I can for them. It's time." Over the years, "[MISC_336]" has become one of the most dissected and argued-about songs in the pop music canon.[PER_815] has said that the opening lines were inspired by the death of[PER_817], but after that, it's all been conjecture -- which hasn't stopped a marching band's worth of analysts from trying to parse the symbols in the 8-minute, 33-second opus. arse the symbols in the 8-minute, 33-second opus. Is the jester[PER_821]? The football game Vietnam? The "girl who sang the blues"[PER_845]? (One thing's certain:[PER_817]'s plane was NOT named "American Pie.") "Over the years I've dealt with all these stupid questions of 'Who's that?' and 'Who's that?' "[PER_815] said. "These are things I never had in my head for a second when I wrote the song. I was trying to capture something very ephemeral and I did, but it took a long time." The song catapulted the former folk singer to headliner status. The song hit No. 1 in early 1972, despite its length. (The 45-rpm single split the song in half on its A and B sides.) The draft that was auctioned is 16 pages: 237 lines of manuscript and 26 lines of typed text, according to[ORG_461]. It includes lines that didn't make the final version as well as extensive notes -- all of which should be revealing,[PER_815] said.

HEADLINE:[PER_846]'s brother[PER_847] pretended to be black to get into med school .
[PER_848]: That's offensive and ironic, considering that minorities experience many disadvantages .
========================================
([ORG_3])You may know[PER_846] from[ORG_354]'s cult hit comedy "[MISC_360]," in which she plays[PER_849], a perky, quirky OB/GYN juggling her career and love life in[LOC_147]. (Only in the[LOC_389] can a doctor not afford an apartment!) The show was a breakthrough for on-screen representation — the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color — and it looks likely to barring a woman of color — and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 2015-16 season. Recently, however,[PER_850]'s brother[PER_847] unveiled a project of his own, and while it has been getting a lot of attention, it hasn't generated quite as many laughs — either from observers or from his famous sibling, who told him it brought "shame upon their family." You see,[PER_851] revealed that, as an undergraduate at the[ORG_464], he engaged in a daring (his view) or ridiculous and offensive (pretty much everyone else) scam: He applied to medical school claiming to be[MISC_297].[PER_851] had spent his college years as a "hard-partying frat boy," and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 GPA. Upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options, he realized that fellow[MISC_361] with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice — but that "black,[MISC_362], and[MISC_183] applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to g grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance." This revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man, both to "dramatically improve" his chances of admission, and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools. To accomplish this goal,[PER_851] shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks, trimmed his "long[MISC_363] eyelashes," checked "black" under the optional race/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname "[PER_852]." He received invitations for in-person interviews at 11 schools, results that he claims support the notion that[MISC_255] garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or[MISC_364]. And now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired, he's looking to write a book on his experiences, titled "Almost Black: The True Story of an[MISC_365] Who Got Into Medical School Pretending toAmerican Who Got Into Medical School Pretending to Be an African[MISC_21][ORG_105]" What's truly curious is that even if you agree with[PER_851] that affirmative action is merely a form of "systematic racism," when all is said and done, it offers very little evidence of the "privilege" that he claims is accorded to black,[MISC_362] and Native[MISC_21] candidates[ORG_105][PER_851] had mediocre grades and[MISC_367]s, but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation[ORG_105] Yet even while representing himself as black,[PER_851] received only a single admission offer, to[ORG_465][ORG_105][ORG_466]'s[ORG_467], which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings[ORG_105] Harvard,[ORG_469],[ORG_268] and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him[ORG_105] Meanwhile, he admits, pretending to be black came with disadvantages[ORG_105] He found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops — who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them howhim while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost, implying that he must have stolen it. These acts of very real prejudice, experienced regularly by blacks and[MISC_368] of all backgrounds — multimillionaire comedian[PER_550] has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason — didn't seem to dissuade[PER_851] from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision-making. It's not just a matter of what individual applicants "deserve." One-third of[MISC_14] are black,[MISC_362] or[MISC_183]; just one in 10 physicians are. Since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities, this lack of diversity has produced "doctor deserts," in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians. Years ago, wut access to primary care physicians. Years ago, when I told my father — a doctor from a long line of doctors — that I didn't want to follow in his footsteps, he told me that was fine, because medicine is a service trade, and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession. A medical degree isn't a reward to be earned, he said, but a responsibility to be accepted. Which really cuts to the heart of what's so sad about[PER_851]'s racial farce. Like others who've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities — including putative presidential candidate[PER_109], who registered himself as "[MISC_369]" on a 2009 voter form, and[LOC_91] Sen.[PER_853], who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed[MISC_183] ancestry in the past —[PER_851] wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people's burden. Race isn't just about color or blood; it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present-dayces and inherited cultural context and present-day condition of a community of people. Many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive; others are deeply painful. Affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation's history; an imperfect one, but necessary. There are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own. Industries like health care and[LOC_75]. Because what's most ironic about[PER_851]'s decision to ride on his sister's coattails in telling his story: While[MISC_364] are well represented in medicine, our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world, and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like[PER_846], it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces, voices and stories.[PER_850]'s immense talent and charisma made her a star. But it was a quota-based affirmative action initiative --[ORG_417]'s Diversity Writers Program -- that gave her a start.
